urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.1.1#[1] I will weave together for you various stories into this Milesian tale, and I will delight your well-inclined ears with witty whispers, provided that you are willing to peruse this Egyptian papyrus that has been written on with a Nilotic pen. You will be amazed at how the appearance and fortunes of men were changed into different shapes, and how in the course of things they were changed back again. I begin: “Who is this person?” Listen. Hymettus, Athens, Isthmia, Ephyre, Tenaros, and Sparta, being fat and fertile soils (as I pray you give credit to the books of more everlasting fame) are places where my ancient progeny and lineage once flourished. There I say, at Athens, when I was young, I went first to school. Soon after (as a stranger) I arrived at Rome, where by great industry and without instruction of any schoolmaster, I attained the full perfection of the Latin tongue. Behold, I first crave and beg your pardon, lest I should happen to displease or offend any of you by the rude and rustic utterance of this strange and foreign language. And indeed this new alteration of speech corresponds to the matter I intend to treat: I will set forth to you (in Latin) a pleasant Greek story. Whereupon, gentle reader, if you will give attendant ear, it will minister to you such delectable matter that will give you pleasure.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.2.1#[2] I happened to take a journey into Thessaly, about certain affairs which I had to take care of (for there my ancestry by my mother’s side inhabits, descended of the line of that most excellent person Plutarch, and of Sextus the Philosopher his nephew, which is to us a great honor) and after I, by much travel and great pain, had passed over the high mountains and slippery valleys, and had ridden through the cloggy fallowed fields, I perceived that my horse seemed somewhat tired. So that I likewise might repose and strengthen myself (being weary with riding), I lighted off my horse and, wiping the sweat from every part of his body, I unbridled him, and walked him softly in my hand, so that he might urinate and ease himself of his weariness and travel. And while he went grazing freshly in the field (casting his head sometimes aside, as a token of rejoicing and gladness) I perceived a little before me two companions riding, and so I overtaking them made a third. And while I listened to their conversation, one of them laughed and mocked his fellow, saying, “Leave off, I pray you, and speak no more, for I cannot abide to hear you tell such absurd and incredible lies.” When I heard this, I desired to hear some news, and said, “I pray you masters make me partaker of your talk; I am not so curious as desirous to know all your conversation. So we shall shorten our journey, and easily pass this high hill before us by merry and pleasant talk.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.3.1#[3] But he who laughed before at his fellow, said again, “Verily this tale is true, if a man could say that by sorcery and enchantment rivers might be forced to run against their course, the seas to be immovable, the air to lack the blowing of winds, the sun to be restrained from its natural race, the moon to purge its skim upon herbs and trees to serve for sorceries, the stars to be pulled from heaven, the day to be darkened and the dark night to continue still.” Then I, being more desirous to hear this talk than his companion, said, “I pray you, who began to tell your tale even now, do not stop, but tell the rest.” And turning to the other I said, “You perhaps, who are of an obstinate mind and gross ears, mock and condemn those things which are reported for truth. You know that those things are counted as untrue by the depraved opinion of men, which either are rarely seen, seldom heard, or pass the capacity of man’s reason. If these things be more closely examined, you shall not only find them evident and plain, but also very easy to be brought to pass.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.4.1#[4] “The other night, being at supper with a sort of hungry fellows, while I greedily put a great morsel of meat in my mouth that was fried with the flower of cheese and barley, it cleaved so fast in the passage of my throat and stopped my breath in such a way that I was nearly choked. And yet at Athens in front of the Painted Porch I saw with these eyes a juggler who swallowed up a two-handed sword with a very keen edge, and by and by for a little money which we who looked on gave him, he devoured a chasing spear with the point downward. And after he had conveyed the whole spear within the closure of his body, and brought it out again behind, there appeared on the top of it (which caused us all to marvel) a fair boy, pleasant and nimble, winding and turning himself in such way that you would suppose he had neither bone nor gristle, and verily think that he was a natural serpent, creeping and sliding on the knotted staff which the god of medicine is feigned to bear.” But turning to him who began his tale I said, “I pray you, follow your intention, and I alone will give credit to you, and for your pains will pay your charges at the next inn we come to.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.5.1#[5] He answered me: “Certainly, sir, I thank you for your gentle offer, and at your request I will proceed in my tale. But first I will swear to you by the light of this sun that shines here, that those things shall be true. At least, when you come to the next city in Thessaly, you should not doubt anything of that which is rife in the mouths of every person and done before the face of all men. And so that I may first make relation to you, what and who I am, and whither I go, and for what purpose, know that I am from Aegina, traveling these countries from Thessaly to Aetolia, and from Aetolia to Boeotia, to obtain honey, cheese, and other victuals to sell again. And understanding that at Hypata (which is the principal city of all Thessaly) there is accustomed to be sold new cheese of exceeding good taste and relish, I happened one day to go there to make my market there. But as often happens, I came at an evil hour. For one Lupus, a purveyor, had bought and engrossed up all the day before, and so I was deceived. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.6.1#[6] “Wherefore towards night, being very weary, I went to the baths to refresh myself, and behold, I happened to see my companion Socrates sitting upon the ground, covered with a torn and course mantle. He was so meager and of so sallow and miserable a countenance that I scarcely knew him. For fortune had brought him into such condition and calamity that he verily seemed as a common beggar that stands in the streets to ask for the charity of the passers by. I drew near to him (although he was my singular friend and familiar acquaintance, I did so half in despair) and said, ‘Alas my Socrates, what does this mean? How do you fair? What crime have you committed? Indeed there is great lamentation and weeping for you at home. Your children are in ward by decree of the Provincial Judge. Your wife (having ended her mourning time in a lamentable fashion, with face and visage so full of tears such that she has nearly wept out both her eyes) is constrained by her parents to put out of remembrance the unfortunate loss and lack of you at home, and against her will to take a new husband. And do you live here as a ghost, to our great shame and ignominy?’ Then he answered me and said, ‘O my friend Aristomenes, now I perceive well that you are ignorant of the whirling changes, the unstable forces, and slippery inconstancy of Fortune.’ And thereupon he covered his face (even then blushing for very shame) with his rugged mantle such that from his navel downwards he was all naked. But I, not willing to see him any longer in such great misery and calamity, took him by the hand and lifted him up from the ground.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.7.1#[7] “He, having his face covered in this way, said, ‘Let Fortune triumph yet more, let her have her sway, and finish that which she has begun.’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.7.2#At this I took off one of my garments and covered him, and immediately I brought him to the bath, and caused him to be anointed, wiped, and the filthy scurf of his body to be rubbed away. With this done, though I was very weary myself, I led the poor wretch to my inn, where he reposed his body upon a bed, Then I brought him food and drink, and so we talked together. For there we might be merry and laugh at our pleasure, and so we were, until such time as he (fetching a pitiful sigh from the bottom of his heart, and beating his face in miserable sort) began to speak: ‘Alas, poor wretch that I am, that only for the desire to see a game of trial of weapons, I have fallen into these miseries and wretched snares of misfortune. For on my return from Macedon, where I sold all my wares, and played the merchant during the space of ten months, a little before I came to Larissa, I turned off the road to view the situation of the country there, and behold, in the bottom of a deep valley I was suddenly beset by a company of thieves who robbed and spoiled me of everything I had, and would hardly let me escape. But I, being in such extremity, in the end was happily delivered from their hands, and so I happened to come to the house of an old woman who sold wine, called Meroe, who had her tongue sufficiently instructed to flattery. To her I explained the causes of my long peregrination and careful travel, and of my unlucky adventure. And after I had declared to her such things as then presently came to my remembrance, she gently entertained me and made me good cheer; and by and by, being pricked with carnal desire, she brought me to her own bed chamber; I, poor wretch, the very first night of our lying together purchased for myself this miserable condition, and for her lodging I gave to her such apparel as the thieves left to cover me with.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.8.1#[8] “Then, I understanding the cause of his miserable condition, said to him, ‘Indeed you deserve to sustain the most extreme misery and calamity which has defiled and maculated your own body: you have forsaken your wife traitorously, and dishonored your children, parents, and friends, for the love of a vile harlot and old strumpet.’ When Socrates heard me rail against Meroe in such sort, he held up his finger to me, and half abashed said, ‘Peace, peace I pray you,’ and, looking about lest anybody should hear, said ‘I pray you, I pray you take heed what you say against so venerable a woman as she is, lest by your intemperate tongue you catch some harm.’ Then with resemblance of admiration I said, ‘Who is this so excellent a person as you name her to be? I pray you tell me.’ Then he answered, ‘Truly she is a witch who has power to rule the heavens, to bring down the sky, to bear up the earth, to turn the waters into hills and the hills into running waters, to lift up the terrestrial spirits into the air, and to pull the gods out of the heavens, to extinguish the planets, and to lighten the deep darkness of hell.’ Then I said to Socrates, ‘Leave off this high and mystical kind of talk, and tell the matter in a more plain and simple fashion.’ Then he answered, ‘Will you hear one or two or more of the deeds that she has done? For she forces not only the inhabitants of the country here, but also the Indians and the Ethiopians and the Anticthones, to love her in most raging fashion. These are but trifles of her occupation, but I pray you give ear, and I will declare greater matters which she has done openly and before the face of all men.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.9.1#[9] “‘Indeed Aristomenes, to tell you the truth, this woman had a certain lover, whom by the utterance of one word she turned into a beaver, because he loved another woman beside her. And the reason why she transformed him into such a beast is that it is its nature, when he perceives the hunters and hounds to draw after him, to bite off his members, and lay them in the way so that the hounds may stop when they find them. Therefore, so that this might so happen to him (for he fancied another woman), she turned him into that kind of shape. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.9.2#“‘Seemingly she changed one of her neighbors, being an old man and one that sold wine, into a frog because he was one of her occupation, and therefore she bore him a grudge. And now the poor wretch, swimming in one of his casks of wine and nearly drowned in the dregs, cries and calls with an hoarse voice for his old guests and acquaintance that pass by. Likewise she turned one of the Advocates of the Court (because he pleaded and spoke against her in a rightful cause) into a horned ram, and now the poor ram is become an Advocate. Moreover she caused the wife of a certain lover that she had never to be delivered of her child: according to the computation of all men it is eight years past since the poor woman first began to swell, and now she is increased so big that she seems as though she would bring forth some great elephant.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.10.1#[10] “‘When this was known abroad and made public throughout all the town, they became indignant against her, and ordained that the next day she should most cruelly be stoned to death. This intention of theirs she prevented by the virtue of her enchantments, and as Medea (who obtained of King Creon but one days respite before her departure) burned the king, his daughter, and his house, so she, by her conjurations and invocations of spirits (which she uses in a certain hole in her house, as she herself declared to me the next day following), locked all the persons in the town in their houses with such violence of power that for the space of two days they could not get forth, nor open their gates nor door, nor break down their walls. Thus they were forced by mutual consent to cry to her and to bind themselves strictly by oaths to the effect that they would never afterwards molest or hurt her. Moreover, if anyone offered her any injury, they would be ready to defend her. Whereupon she, moved by their promises, and stirred by pity, released all the town. But she conveyed the principal author of this ordinance about midnight with all his house, the walls, the ground, and the foundation, into another town, distant from thence a hundred miles, which was situated on the top of a high hill, and for this reason destitute of water. Because the edifices and houses there were built so close together, it was not possible for the house to stand there, and so she threw it down before the gate of the town.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.11.1#[11] “Then I spoke and said ‘O my friend Socrates you have declared to me many marvelous things and strange chances, and moreover you have stricken me with no small trouble of mind, indeed with great fear, lest the same old woman using the like practice, should happen to hear all our conversation. Wherefore let us now sleep, and after that we have taken our rest, let us rise early in the morning and ride away here before day as far as we can.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.11.2#“In speaking these words, and devising with myself of our departure the next morning, lest Meroe the witch should play by us as she had done by diverse other persons, it happened that Socrates fell asleep, and slept very soundly because of his travail and the large amount of food and wine he had filled himself with. Wherefore I closed and barred the doors of the chamber and put my bed behind the door, and so laid myself down to rest. But I could in no way sleep because of the great fear which was in my heart until it was about midnight, and then I began to slumber. But alas, behold, suddenly the chamber doors were broken open, and locks, bolts, and posts fell down, so that you would verily have thought that some thieves had presently come to spoil and rob us. And the bed I was lying on, being a truckle bed and fashioned in form of a cradle, and having one of its feet broken and rotten, by violence was turned upside down. And I likewise was overturned and covered by it. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.12.1#[12] “Then I perceived in myself that certain affects of the mind by nature cause strange reactions. For as tears oftentimes trickle down the cheeks of him who sees or hears some joyful news, so I, being in this fearful perplexity, could not forbear laughing, to see how I was made like a snail in his shell. And while I lay on the ground covered in this way, I peeped under the bed to see what would happen. And behold, there entered two old women, one bearing a burning torch, and the other a sponge and a naked sword. And so in this way they stood about Socrates who was fast asleep. Then she who bore the sword said to the other, ‘Behold, sister Panthia, this is my dear and sweet heart, who both day and night has abused my wanton youthfulness. This is he, who little regarding my love, not only defames me with reproachful words, but also intends to run away. And I shall be forsaken by a trick similar to the one Ulysses used, and shall continually bewail my abandoned state like Calypso.’ This said, she pointed towards me who lay under the bed, and showed me to Panthia. ‘This is he,’ she said, ‘who is his counselor and persuades him to forsake me, and now, being at the point of death, he lies prostrate on the ground covered with his bed, and has seen all our doings, and hopes to escape scot-free from my hands. But I will make him repent too late, nay rather immediately, of his former intemperate language and his present curiosity.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.13.1#[13] “When I heard these words I fell into a cold sweat, and my heart trembled with fear, so much so that the bed over me likewise rattled and shook. Then Panthia said to Meroe, ‘Sister, let us by and by tear him in pieces or tie him by the members and cut them off.’ Then Meroe (being so named because she was an innkeeper and loved well good wines) answered, ‘Nay rather let him live, and bury the corpse of this poor wretch in some hole of the earth;’ Thereupon she turned the head of Socrates to one side and thrust her sword up to the hilt into the left part of his neck, and received the blood that gushed out in a pot, so that no drop fell on the floor. These things I saw with my own eyes, and, since I thought that she might change nothing that pertained to the sacrifices which she accustomed to make, she thrust her hand down into the entrails of his body, and, searching about, at length brought forth the heart of my miserable companion Socrates. He, having his throat cut in this way, yielded out a doleful cry and gave up the ghost. Then Panthia stopped up the wide wound of his throat with the sponge and said, ‘O sponge, sprung and made in the sea, beware that you not pass by running river.’ This being said, one of them moved and turned up my bed, and then they strode over me, and clapped their buttocks upon my face, and all pissed on me until I was wringing wet. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.14.1#[14] “When this was over they went their ways, and the doors closed fast, the posts stood in their old places, and the locks and bolts were shut again. But I, who lay upon the ground like one without soul, naked and cold, and wringing wet with piss, like one who was more than half dead, revived myself. Since I thought I was headed for the gallows, I began to say ‘Alas, what shall become of me tomorrow, when my companion shall be found murdered here in the chamber? To whom shall I seem to tell any similitude of truth, even though I shall tell the truth indeed? They will say, “If you were unable to resist the violence of the women, you should at least have cried for help; would you suffer the man to be slain before your face and say nothing? Or why did they not slay you likewise? Why did they spare you who stood by and saw them commit that horrible deed? Wherefore, although you have escaped their hands, you shall not escape ours.”’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.14.2#While I pondered these things with myself the night passed on, and so I resolved to take my horse before day, and go forward on my journey. “However, the ways were unknown to me, and thereupon I took up my packet, unlocked and unbarred the doors. But those good and faithful doors, which in the night had opened of their own accord, could then scarcely be opened with their keys. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.15.1#[15] “And when I got out I cried, ‘Doorman! Where are you? Open the stable door, for I want to ride away now.’ The doorman, lying behind the stable door upon a pallet and half asleep, said, ‘What, do you not know that the roads are very dangerous? Why do you rise at this time of night? If you, perhaps guilty of some heinous crime, are weary of your life, at least don’t think that we are such sots that we will die for you.’ Then I said, ‘It is nearly day, and moreover, what can thieves take from him who has nothing? Do you not know (fool as you are) that, if you be naked, if ten giants should assail you, they could not spoil or rob you?’ Whereupon the drowsy doorman, half asleep and turning on his other side, answered, ‘What do I know whether you have murdered your companion whom you brought in yesternight or no, and now seek the means to escape away?’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.15.2#O Lord, at that time I remember the earth seemed ready to open, and I thought I saw at hell gate the dog Cerberus ready to devour me. And then I truly believed that Meroe did not spare my throat because she was moved by pity, but rather she cruelly pardoned me to bring me to the gallows. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.16.1#[16] “Wherefore I returned to my chamber, and there devised with myself in what way I could finish my life. But when I saw that fortune could offer to me no other instrument than that which my bed proffered me, I said, ‘O bed, O bed, most dear to me at present, who have suffered with me so many miseries, judge and arbiter of such things as were done here this night, whom alone I may call to witness for my innocence, render (I say) to me some wholesome weapon to end my life, I who am most willing to die.’ And thereupon I pulled out a piece of the rope with which the bed was corded, and tied one end of it to a rafter by the window, and on the other end I made a sliding knot. I stood upon my bed and put my neck in the rope, and leaped from the bed, thinking to strangle myself and so die. But behold, the rope, being old and rotten, burst in the middle, and I fell down upon Socrates who lay underneath. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.17.1#[17] “And at that same very moment the doorman came in, crying with a loud voice, and said, ‘Where are you who made such haste at midnight, and now lies wallowing in bed?’ Whereupon (I don’t know whether it was by my fall or by the great cry of the stable boy) Socrates, as though waking out of sleep, rose up and said, ‘It is not without cause that strangers speak evil of all such doormen, for this sneak, in his coming in, and with his crying out (I think with the intention to steal away something), has waked me out of a sound sleep.’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.17.2#Then I rose up, joyful with a merry countenance, saying, ‘Behold, good doorman, my friend, my companion and my brother, whom you falsely affirmed to have been slain by me this night.’ And thereupon I embraced my friend Socrates and kissed him. But he, smelling the stink of the piss those hags had drenched me with, thrust me away and said, ‘Cleanse yourself of this filthy odor.’ And then he began gently to enquire how that noisome scent happened to get on me. But I, finely feigning and coloring the matter for the time, broke off his talk, and took him by the hand and said, ‘Why do we delay? Why should we lose the pleasure of this fair morning? Let us go.’ And so I took up my packet, and paid the charges of the house and departed. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.18.1#[18] “And we had not gone a mile out of the town when it became broad day, and then I diligently looked upon Socrates’ throat, to see if I could see the place where Meroe thrust in her sword. But when I could not perceive any such thing, I thought to myself, ‘What a mad man I am, who, being overcome with wine last night, dreamed such terrible things? Behold I see Socrates is sound, safe and in health. Where is his wound? Where is the sponge? Where is his great and new cut?’ And then I spoke to him and said, ‘Truly it is not without occasion that physicians of experience do affirm that those who fill themselves abundantly with food and drink shall dream of dire and horrible sights. For I myself, not tempering my appetite last night from the pots of wine, seemed to see strange and cruel visions, that even yet I think myself sprinkled and wet with human blood.’ Whereupon Socrates, laughing, made answer and said, ‘Nay, you are not wet with the blood of men, but are wet with stinking piss. Indeed I dreamed that my throat was cut, and that I felt the pain of the wound, and that my heart was pulled out of my belly. Remembering this makes me now afraid, for my knees so tremble that I can scarce go any further. Therefore I would like eat something to strengthen and revive my spirits.’ Then I said, ‘Behold, here your breakfast.’ And thereupon I opened my bag that hung upon my shoulder, and gave him bread and cheese, and we sat down under a great plane tree, and I ate with him.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.19.1#[19] “And while I watched him eating greedily, I perceived that he grew meager and pale, and that his lively color faded away, so that, being in great fear and remembering those terrible furies of whom I lately dreamed, the first morsel of bread that I put in my mouth (which was very small) so stuck in my jaws that I could neither swallow it down, nor yet yield it up. Moreover, the small time of our being together increased my fear. And why would he, who saw his companion die on the highway before his face, not greatly lament and be sorry? But when Socrates had eaten sufficiently, he grew very thirsty, for indeed he had nearly devoured a whole cheese. And behold, evil fortune! There was behind the plane tree a pleasant running water, as clear as crystal, and I said to him, ‘Come here, Socrates, to this water and drink your fill.’ And then he rose and came to the river, and kneeled down on the side of the bank to drink. But he had scarce touched the water with lips when behold, the wound in his throat opened wide, and the sponge suddenly fell out into the water, and after it issued out a little remnant of blood, and his body, being then without life, would have fallen into the river, had not I caught him by the leg and so pulled him up. And after I had lamented for some time the death of my wretched companion, I buried him in the sands there by the river. With this done, in great fear I rode through many outways and deserted places, and because I was culpable for the death of Socrates, I forsook my country, my wife, and my children, and came to Aetolia where I married another wife.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.20.1#[20] This tale Aristomenes told, and his fellow, who before obstinately would give no credit to him, began to say, “Truly there was never so foolish a tale, nor a more absurd lie told than this.” And then he spoke to me saying, “Ho sir, who you are I know not, but your habit and countenance declare that you are some honest gentleman. Do you believe this tale?” “Yea verily,” said I, “why not? For whatever the fates have appointed to men I believe shall happen. For may things chance to me and to you, and to diverse others, which when they are declared to the ignorant are accounted as lies. But verily I give credit to his tale, and render entire thanks to him, since by the pleasant telling of the story we have quickly passed and shortened our journey. And I think my horse was also delighted with it too, and has brought me to the gate of this city without any pain at all.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.21.1#[21] Thus ended both our talk and our journey, for those two turned to the left to the next villages, and I rode into the city. After those two companions departed, I entered the city where I spotted an old woman, whom I asked whether the city was called Hypata or not. She answered, “Yes.” Then I demanded whether she knew one Milo, an Alderman of the city. At this she laughed and said: “Verily it is not without cause that Milo is called an Alderman, and accounted as chief of those which dwell without the walls of the city.” To her I said again, “I pray you, good mother, do not jest but tell me what manner of man he is, and where he dwells.” “Indeed,” she said, “do you see these bay windows which on one side abut to the gates of the city, and on the other side to the next lane? There Milo dwells, very rich both in money and substance, but by reason of his great avarice and insatiable covetousness, he is evil spoken of, and he is a man who lives entirely by usury and lending his money upon pledges. Moreover he dwells in a small house and is always counting his money, and he has a wife who is a companion of his extreme misery. Nor does he keep more than only one maid in his house, who goes appareled like a beggar.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.22.1#[22] When I heard this, I laughed to myself and thought, “Indeed my friend Demeas has served me well. He has sent me, being a stranger, to such a man in whose house I shall not be afraid either of smoke or of the scent of meat.” And thereupon I rode to the door, which was fast barred, and knocked aloud. Then there came forth a maid who said, “Ho sir who knocks so fast, in what way do you want to borrow money? Don’t you know that we are accustomed to take no surety, unless it is either plate or jewels?” To her I answered, “I pray you, maid, speak more gently and tell me whether your master be within or not?” “Yes,” said she, “he is: why do you ask?” “Indeed,” I said, “I am from Corinth, and have brought him letters from Demeas his friend.” Then the maid said, “I pray you wait here till I tell him.” And thereupon she closed fast the door, and went in, and after a while she returned again and said, “My master desires you to alight and come in.” And so I did, and I found him sitting on a little bed going to supper, and his wife sat at his feet, but there was no food on the table. And so by appointment of the maid I came to him and saluted him, and delivered the letters that I had brought from Demeas. When he had read them he said, “Verily, I thank my friend Demeas much since he has sent me so worthy a guest as you.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.23.1#[23] And thereupon he commanded his wife to move aside and bid me sit in her place. When I refused this by reason of courtesy, he pulled me by my garment and willed me to sit down. “For we have,” he said, “no other stool here, nor no other great store of household stuff, for fear of robbery.” Then I, according to his command, sat down, and he fell in further conversation with me and said, “Verily I do conjecture by the handsome features of your body and by the maidenly modesty of your face, that you are a gentleman, as my friend Demeas has no less declared in his letters. Wherefore I pray you take in good part our poor lodging, and behold yonder chamber is at your command. Use it as your own, and if you are contented with it, you shall resemble and follow the virtuous qualities of your good father Theseus, who did not disdain the slender and poor cottage of Hecale.” And then he called his maid (who was named Fotis), and said, “Carry this gentleman’s packet into the chamber, and store safely, and bring water quickly to wash him, and a towel to rub him, and other things necessary, and then bring him to the baths, for I know that he is very weary of travel.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.24.1#[24] When I heard these things, I partly perceived the manners of Milo and, endeavoring to bring myself further into his favor, I said, “Sir there is no need of any of these things, for they have been everywhere ministered to me on the way. However, I will go into the baths, but my main care is that my horse is well looked after, for he brought me here stoutly, and therefore I pray you, Fotis, take this money and buy some hay and oats for him.” When this was done, and all my things brought into the chamber, I walked towards the baths. But first I went to the market to buy some victuals for my supper. There I saw great plenty of fish set out to be sold. And so I bargained with the vendors, and that which they at first held at an hundred pence, I bought at length for twenty. When I had done this, and was departing away, one of my old acquaintances and fellows from Athens named Pythias happened to pass by and, watching me for some time, in the end remembered me, and gently came up and kissed me, saying, “O my dear friend Lucius, it has been a long time since we two saw one another, and moreover, from the time that we departed from our master Clytius, I never heard any news from you. I pray you, Lucius, tell me the cause of your journey here.” Then I answered and said, “I will tell you about this tomorrow. But I pray you tell me, what is the meaning of these servants that follow you, and these rods or verges which they bear, and this habit which you wear like to a magistrate? Verily I think you have obtained your own desire, for which I am glad.” Then answered Pythias, “I bear the office of the clerk of the market, and therefore, if you have any pittance for your supper, speak and I will obtain it for you.” Then I thanked him heartily and said I had bought sufficient food already. But Pythias, when he saw my basket containing my fish, took it and shook it, and demanded of me what I had paid. “Indeed,” said I, “I could scarce force the fishmonger to sell them for twenty pence.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.25.1#[25] When he heard this, he brought me back again into the market, and asked me whom I bought the fish from. I showed him the old man who sat in a corner. This man, by and by, by reason of his office, he greatly blamed, and said, “Is it thus you serve and handle strangers, and especially our friends? Why sell you this fish so dear, which is not worth a halfpenny? Now I perceive well that you are trying to make this place, which is the principal city of all Thessaly, to be forsaken of all men, and to reduce it into an uninhabitable desert, by reason of your excessive prices of victuals. But assure yourself that you shall not escape without punishment, and you shall know what my office is, and how I ought to punish those who offend.” Then he took my basket and cast the fish on the ground, and commanded one of his sergeants to tread them under his feet. This done he persuaded me to depart, and said that the shame and reproach done to the old sneak sufficed him. So I went away amazed and astonished towards the baths, considering with myself the grace of my companion Pythias. When I had well washed and refreshed my body, I returned again to Milo’s house, both without money and food, and so went into my chamber. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:1.26.1#[26] Then Fotis came immediately to me and said that her master desired me to come to supper. But I, not ignorant of Milo’s parsimony, prayed that I might be excused since I thought it best to ease my wearied bones rather with sleep and rest, than with food. When Fotis had told this to Milo, he came himself and took me by the hand, and while I modestly excused myself, said “I will not depart from this place until such time as you shall go with me.” And to confirm the this, he bound his words with an oath. And so he made me follow him and brought me into his chamber, where he sat down on the bed, and asked me how his friend Demeas was, his wife, his children, and all his family. And I answered every question. He especially enquired the causes of my peregrination and travel which, when I had told him, he yet busily demanded of the state of my country, and the chief magistrates there, and principally of our Lieutenant and Viceroy. When he perceived that I was not only wearied by travel, but also with talk, and that I fell asleep in the midst of my tale, and further that I spoke nothing directly or advisedly, he suffered me to depart to my chamber. So escaped I at length from the prating and hungry supper of this rank old man and, being compelled by sleep and not by food, and having supped only with talk, I returned into my chamber and there betook myself to quiet and long desired rest. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.1.1#[1] As soon as night was passed and the day began to dawn, I happened to awake, and rose out of my bed half amazed and very desirous to know and see some marvelous and strange things, remembering that I was in the middle part of all Thessaly, where by the common report of all the world the sorceries and enchantments are most used. I often repeated with myself the tale of my companion Aristomenes regarding this city and, being moved by great desire, I viewed the whole situation in this light. Neither was there anything I saw there that I did believe to be what it appeared, but everything seemed to me to be transformed and altered into other shapes by the wicked power of sorcery and enchantment: I thought the stones I found had been turned from men into that figure. I thought the birds I heard chirping, and the trees outside the walls of the city, and the running waters, were changed from men into such kind of likenesses. And further I thought the statues, images, and walls could move, and the oxen and other brute beasts could speak and tell strange news, and that immediately I could see and hear oracles from the heavens, and from the glowing ember of the sun. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.2.1#[2] Thus, being astonished or rather dismayed and vexed with desire, knowing no certain place where I intended to go, I went from street to street and at length (as I curiously gazed on everything) I happened unawares to come into the market place where I saw a certain woman accompanied with a great many servants. I drew near her and viewed her garments adorned with gold and precious stones in such a way that she seemed to be some noble matron. And there was an old man who followed her who, as soon as he saw me, said to himself, “Verily this is Lucius,” and then he came and embraced me, and by and by he went to his mistress and whispered in her ear, and came to me again saying, “How is it, Lucius, that you do not greet your dear aunt and singular friend?” To him I answered, “Sir, I dare not be so bold as to take acquaintance of an unknown woman.” However, half ashamed I drew towards her, and she turned and said, “Behold, how he resembles the very same grace as his mother Salvia does, behold his countenance and stature, looking like her in each point, behold his comely state, his fine slenderness, his ruddy color, his hair yellow by nature, his gray and quick eyes like to the eagle, and his trim and comely gait. All this sufficiently proves him to be the natural child of Salvia.” And moreover she said, <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.3.1#[3] “O Lucius, I have nourished you with my own hand: and why not? For I am not only kindred to your mother by blood but also by nourish, for we both descended of the line of Plutarch, lay in one womb, suckled the same breasts, and were brought up together in one house. And further, there is no other difference between us two except that she is married more honorably than I. I am the same Byrrhena whom you have often heard named amongst your friends at home. Wherefore I pray you to take such pains as to come with me to my house, and use it as your own.” At whose words I was partly abashed and said, “God forbid, aunt, that I should forsake my host Milo without any reasonable cause. But verily I will, as often as I have occasion to pass by your house, come and see you.” And while we went talking thus together, by little and little we came to her house.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.4.1#[4] Behold, the gates were very beautifully set with pillars quadrangle-wise, on the top were placed carved statues and images. But principally the goddess of Victory was so lively and with such excellence portrayed and set forth that you would verily have thought that she had flew, and hovered with her wings hither and thither. On the other side the image of the goddess Diana was wrought in white marble, a marvelous sight to see, for she seemed as though the wind blew up her garments, and that she encountered those who came into the house. On each side of her were dogs made of stone that seemed to menace with their fiery eyes, their pricked ears, their bended nostrils, and their grinning teeth, such that you would have thought they bayed and barked. And moreover (a greater marvel to behold) the excellent sculptor of this work had fashioned the dogs to raise up fiercely their front feet, and to keep their hind feet on the ground ready to fight. Behind the back of the goddess was carved a stone in manner of a cavern, environed with moss, herbs, leaves, sprigs, green branches and boughs, growing in and about her. Within the stone it glittered and shone marvelously, under the brim of the stone hung apples and grapes carved finely; herein Art, striving with Nature, showed her great cunning. For they were so lively set out that you would have thought that summer had been come, that they might have been pulled and eaten. And while I beheld the running water, which seemed to spring and leap under the feet of the goddess, I marked the grapes that hung in the water, which were like in every point to the grapes of the vine, and seemed to move and stir by the violence of the stream. Moreover, amongst the branches of the stone appeared the image of Actaeon, and how Diana (who was carved within the same stone, standing in the water) because he saw her naked, turned him into an deer, and so he was torn and slain by his own hounds. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.5.1#[5] And while I was greatly delighted with viewing these things, Byrrhena spoke to me and said, “Nephew, all things here are at your command.” And thereupon she willed secretly the others to depart. When they were gone she said, “My most dear nephew Lucius, I swear by this goddess Diana, that I do greatly care for your safety, and am as careful for you as if you were my own natural child. Beware, I say, beware of the evil arts and wicked allurements of Pamphile (who is the wife of Milo whom you call your host), for she is accounted the most chief and principal witch and enchantress living, who by breathing out certain words and charms over boughs, stones, and other frivolous things, can throw down all the powers of the heavens in to the deep bottom of hell, and reduce all the whole world again to the old chaos. For as soon as she sees any comely young man, she is immediately stricken with desire, and presently sets her whole mind and affection on him. She sows her seeds of flattery, she invades his spirit and entangles him with continual snares of immeasurable love. And then if any do not accord to her filthy desire, or if they seem loathsome to her eye, by and by in the space of an hour she turns them into stones, sheep, or some other beast, as her self pleases. And some she quickly slays and murders. Of her I would that you should earnestly beware. For she burns continually, and you by reason of your tender age and comely beauty are susceptible to her fire and love.” Thus with great care Byrrhena gave me warning.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.6.1#[6] But I (who always coveted and desired, after I had heard talk of such sorceries and witchcrafts, to be experienced in them) little esteemed to be wary of Pamphile, but willingly determined to bestow my money in learning the art, and now wholly to become a witch. And so I grew joyful and, wringing myself out of my aunt’s company as out of links or chains, I bade her farewell, and departed toward the house of my host Milo, on the way reasoning thus with myself: “O Lucius, now take heed, be vigilant, have a good care, for now you have time and place to satisfy your desire. Now shake off your childishness and show your self a man, but especially temper yourself against the desire of your hostess, and abstain from violation of the bed of Milo. But eagerly attempt to win the maiden Fotis, for she is beautiful, wanton, and pleasant in talk. And soon, when you go to sleep and when she brings you gently into your chamber and tenderly lays you down in your bed and lovingly covers you and kisses you sweetly and departs unwillingly and casts her eyes oftentimes back and stands still, then take the opportunity ministered to you to prove and try the mind of Fotis.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.7.1#[7] Thus while I reasoned with myself, I came to Milo’s door, persevering still in my purpose, but I found neither Milo nor his wife at home. When I went in the house I found my dear and sweet love Fotis mincing meat and making pottage for her master and mistress. The cupboard was all set with wines, and I thought I smelled the savor of some dainty meats. She had about her middle a white and clean apron, and she was girded about her body under the breasts with a scarf of red silk, and she stirred the pot and turned the meat with her fair and white hands, such that, by her stirring and turning, her loins and hips did likewise move and shake, which was in my mind a comely sight to see. When I saw these things I was half amazed, and stood musing with myself, and my courage came then upon me, which before was scant. And I spoke to Fotis merrily and said, “O Fotis how alluringly you can stir the pot, and how finely, by shaking your buttocks, you can make pottage. O happy and twice happy is he to whom you give leave and license but to touch you there.” Then she, being likewise merrily disposed, made answer: “Depart, wretch, from me, depart from my fire, for if its flame blazes forth even a little it will burn you extremely, and none can extinguish its heat but I alone, who in stirring the pot and making the bed can so finely shake myself.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.8.1#[8] When she had said these words she cast her eyes upon me and laughed, but I did not depart from there until such time as I had viewed her in every point. But why should I speak about her other parts, when I am accustomed abroad to mark and view the face and hair of every dame, and afterwards to delight myself with it privately at home, and thereby to judge the rest of their appearance. This is because the face is the principal part of all the body, and is first open to our eyes. And as much as flourishing and gorgeous apparel accentuates the corporal parts of a woman, so also does the natural and comely beauty set out in the face. Moreover, most women, in order to show their grace and feature, will cast off their kerchiefs, collars, clothing, fronts, cornets and purses, and cause more delight in showing the fairness of their skin, than in decking themselves out in gold and precious stones. But because it is a crime for me to say so (and I hope never to give an example of this), know that if you spoil and cut off the hair of any woman, or deprive her of the color of her face, even if she was accompanied with the Graces, even if she wore the beautiful belt of Love, and even if she smelled of perfumes and musks, yet if she appeared bald, she could in no way be pleasing, not even her own Vulcan.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.9.1#[9] O how well does a fair color and a shining face agree with glittering hair! Behold, it encounters the beams of the sun, and pleases the eye marvelously. Sometimes the beauty of the hair resembles the color of gold and honey, sometimes the blue plumes and azure feathers on the necks of doves, especially when it is either anointed with the gum of Arabia or trimly fixed with the teeth of a fine comb. If it is bound up on the neck, it seems to the lover who beholds this like a mirror that yields forth a more pleasant and gracious reflection. What is more pleasant than if the hair should be sprinkled abroad on the shoulders of the woman, or hang down scattering on her back? Finally there is such a dignity in the hair that, whoever she is, though she is not so bravely attired with gold, silks, precious stones, and other rich and gorgeous ornaments, yet if her hair is not curiously set forth she cannot seem fair. But in my Fotis, her loosened and unfastened garments increased her beauty, her hair hung about her shoulders, and was dispersed upon her kerchief, and in every part of her neck, although the greater part was trussed upon her head with a lace. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.10.1#[10] Then I, unable to sustain the broiling heat that I was in, ran upon her and kissed the place where she had thus laid her hair. At this she turned her face and cast her rolling eyes upon me, saying “O scholar, you have tasted now both honey and gall, take heed that your pleasure does not turn into repentance.” “Bah,” I said, “my sweetheart, I will be content, for another such kiss, to be broiled here upon this fire.” Whereupon I embraced and kissed her more often, and she embraced and kissed me likewise, and moreover her breath smelled like cinnamon, and the liquor of her tongue was like to sweet nectar. When my mind was greatly delighted I said, “Behold Fotis I am yours, and shall presently die unless you take pity upon me.” When I had said this, she again kissed me, and bid me be of good courage, and said, “I will satisfy your whole desire, and it shall not be delayed later than tonight when, assure yourself, I will come and lie with you. Wherefore go your ways and prepare yourself, for I intend valiantly and courageously to encounter you this night.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.11.1#[11] Thus when we had lovingly talked and reasoned together, we parted for that time. When noon came, Byrrhena sent me a fat pig, five hens, and a flagon of old wine. Then I called Fotis and said, “Behold how Bacchus, the stirrer of lovemaking, offers himself of his own accord, let us therefore drink up this wine, so that we may prepare ourselves and get courage soon, for Venus wants no other provision than this: that the lamp may be all night replenished with oil, and the cups with wine.” The rest of the day I passed away at the baths and in banqueting, and towards evening I went to supper, for I was bid by Milo, and so I sat down at the table, out of Pamphile’s sight as much as I could, being mindful of the command of Byrrhena. Sometimes I would cast my eyes upon her as upon the furies of hell, but again turning my face behind me, and beholding my Fotis ministering at the table, I was again refreshed and made merry. And behold when Pamphile saw the candle standing on the table, she said, “Verily we shall have much rain tomorrow.” When her husband heard this, he demanded of her by what reason she knew it. “Indeed,” said she, “the light on the table shows it.” The Milo laughed and said, “Verily we nourish here a Sibyl prophesier, who by viewing a candle divines celestial things, concerning the sun itself.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.12.1#[12] Then I mused in my mind and said to Milo, “Truly there is good experience and proof of divination. Neither is it any marvel, for although this light is but a small light and made by the hands of men, yet has it a remembrance of that great and heavenly light, as of its parent, and shows to us what will happen in the skies above. For I knew at Corinth a certain man of Assyria, who would give prophecies in every part of the city, and for the gain of money he would tell every man his fortune. To some he would tell the days of their marriages, to others he would tell when they should build so that their edifices would endure. To others he told when they should go by sea or land. To me, intending to take my journey here, he declared many things strange and variable. For sometimes he said that I would win glory enough, sometimes he said that I should devise an incredible tale, and sometimes that I would write books.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.13.1#[13] At this Milo laughed again and enquired of me of what stature this man of Assyria was, and what he was named. “In truth,” I said, “he is a tall man and somewhat black, and he is called Diophanes.” Then Milo said, “His is the same and no other, who in like manner declared many things here to us, whereby he obtained great substance and treasure. But the poor wretch fell at length into the hands of pitiless and cruel fortune. For being one day amongst a great assembly of people to tell the simple sort their fortune, a certain cobbler came to him, and desired him to tell when it would be best for him to take his voyage. This he promised to do. The cobbler opened his purse and took out a hundred denarii to pay him for his pains. Whereupon came a certain young gentleman and took Diophanes by the garment. Then he, turning himself, embraced and kissed him, and asked the gentleman, who was one of his acquaintances, to sit down by him. Diophanes, being astonished with this sudden change, forgot what he was doing, and said, ‘O dear friend you are heartily welcome, I pray you, when did you arrive in these parts?’ Then he answered, ‘I will tell you soon but, brother, I pray you tell me of your coming from the island of Euboea, and how you sped by the way?’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.14.1#[14] To this Diophanes, this notable Assyrian (not yet come to his mind, but half amazed), soon answered and said, ‘I would to God that all our enemies and evil wishers might fall into similarly dangerous peregrination and trouble. For the ship we were in, after it was tossed hither and thither in great peril, and after the mast and stern broke likewise in pieces, could in no way be brought to shore, but sunk into the water. And so we swam and hardly escaped to land. And after that, whatever was given to us in recompense of our losses, either by the pity of strangers, or by the benevolence of our friends, was taken away from us by thieves. When my brother Arignotus tried to resist their violence, he was cruelly murdered by them before my face.’ When had sadly declared these things, the cobbler took up his money that he had taken out to pay for the telling of his fortune, and ran away. Then Diophanes, coming to his senses, perceived what he had done, and all of us who stood by laughed greatly. But that,” said Milo, “which Diophanes did tell to you Lucius, that you should be happy and have a prosperous journey, was only true.”<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.15.1#[15] Thus Milo reasoned with me. But I was not a little sorry that I had guided him into such a vein of talk, with the result that I lost a good part of the night and its sweet pleasure. But at length I boldly said to Milo, “Let Diophanes fare well with his evil fortune, and gain again what he lost by sea and land. I truly still feel the weariness of my travel, and therefore I pray you pardon me, and give me license to depart to bed.” Whereupon I rose up and went to my chamber, where I found all things finely prepared, and the slaves’ bed (so they would not hear what we did in the night) was removed far off outside the chamber door. The table was all covered with food that was left from supper, and the cups were filled half full with water, so as to temper and delay the wine. The flagon stood ready prepared, and there lacked nothing that was necessary for the preparation of lovemaking. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.16.1#[16] And I, when was getting into bed, beheld my Fotis (who had brought her mistress to bed) came in and gave me roses and flowers that she had in her apron. Some she threw about the bed; she kissed me sweetly and tied a garland about my head, and decked the chamber with the rest of the flowers. When she had done this, she took a cup of wine and diluted it with hot water and proffered it to me to drink. Before I had drunk it all she pulled it from my mouth, and then gave it me again, and in this manner we emptied the pot twice or thrice together. Thus, when I had well replenished myself with wine and was now ready to love not only in mind but also in body, I removed my clothes, and showing to Fotis my great impatience I said, “O my sweetheart, take pity upon me and help me, for as you see I am now prepared for the battle which you your self appointed. For after I felt the first arrow of cruel Cupid within my breast, I bent my bow very tight and now fear (because it bent so hard) that my string may break. But so that you may better please me, undress your hair and come and embrace me lovingly.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.17.1#[17] Whereupon she made no long delay, but set aside all the food and wine, and then undressed herself and unbound her hair, presenting her amiable body to me in manner of fair Venus, when she goes under the waves of the sea. “Now,” said she, “has come the hour of jousting, now has come the time of war. Wherefore show yourself like a man, for I will not retreat, I will not flee from the field. See then that you are valiant, see that you are courageous, since there is no time appointed when our skirmish shall cease.” In saying these words she came to me in bed, and climbed gently on top of me. Bouncing up and down continually and shaking her agile body in lascivious movements, she satisfied me with acrobatic lovemaking. And so we passed all the night in pastime and pleasure, and never stopped until it was day. But we would again refresh our weariness, and provoke our pleasure, and renew our lovemaking by drinking wine. In this way we pleasantly passed away many other nights following.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.18.1#[18] It happened one day that Byrrhena desired me earnestly to dine with her; and she would in no way take any excuse. Whereupon I went to Fotis to ask counsel of her as of some goddess. Although she was unwilling that I should depart one foot from her company, yet at length she gave me license to be absent for a while, saying, “Beware that you tarry not long at supper there, for there is a rabble of common youths and disturbers of the public peace who rove about in the streets and murder all those they encounter. Neither can law nor justice redress them in any case. And they will the sooner set upon you, both because of your comeliness and audacity and because you are not afraid at any time to walk in the streets.” Then I answered and said, “Have no care for me Fotis, for I esteem the pleasure that I have with you above the dainty foods that I eat abroad, and therefore I will return again quickly. Nevertheless I will not go without company, for I have here my sword, whereby I hope to defend my self.”<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.19.1#[19] And so in this way I went to supper, and behold, I found at Byrrhena's house a great company of strangers, consisting of the chief and principal men of the city. The couches, made of citron and ivory, were richly adorned and spread with cloths of gold. The cups were garnished preciously, and there were diverse other things of sundry fashion, but of like cost and price. Here stood a glass gorgeously wrought, there stood another of crystal finely painted. There stood a cup of glittering silver, and here stood another of shining gold, and here was another of amber artificially carved and adorned with precious stones. Finally, there were all things that might be desired. The servants waited orderly at the table in rich apparel; the pages, arrayed in silk robes, filled great gems and pearls made in form of cups with excellent wine. Then one brought in candles and torches, and when we were set down and placed in order we began to talk, to laugh, and to be merry. And Byrrhena spoke to me and said, “I pray you, nephew, how do you like our country? Verily I think there is no other city that has the comparable temples, baths, and other commodities as we have here. Further we have abundance of household stuff, we have pleasure, we have ease, and when the Roman merchants arrive in this city they are gently and quietly entertained, and all that dwell within this province (when they purpose to solace and repose themselves) do come to this city.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.20.1#[20] Whereupon I answered, “Indeed you tell truth, for I can find no place in all the world which I like better than this. But I greatly fear the blind inevitable houses of witches, for they say that dead bodies are dug out of their graves, and the bones of those who are cremated are stolen away, and the toes and fingers of those who are slain are cut off. I hear also that they afflict and torment even those who live. And the old witches, as soon as they hear of the death of any person, immediately go and uncover the tomb and spoil the corpse to work their enchantments.” Then another sitting at the table spoke and said, “Indeed you spead truly, neither yet do they spare or favor the living. For I know one not far hence who was cruelly handled by them. They, being not content with cutting off his nose, did likewise cut off his ears.” At this all the people laughed heartily, and looked upon one who sat at the board’s end. He, being amazed at their gazing and somewhat angry with it, would have risen from the table, had not Byrrhena spoke to him and said, “I pray the friend Thelyphron, sit still, and according to your accustomed courtesy declare to us the loss of your nose and ears, so that my nephew Lucius may be delighted with the pleasantness of the tale.” To her he answered, “Madam, you in the office of your bounty shall prevail here, but the insolence of some is not to be supported.” This he said very angrily. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.21.1#[21] But Byrrhena was earnest with him, and assured him he would have no wrong at any man’s hand. Whereby he was prevailed upon to declare his story, and so, piling up on the end of the table cloth and carpets together, he leaned on them with his elbow and held out the three forefingers of his right hand in manner of an orator and said, 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.21.2#“When I was a young man I went to a certain city called Miletus, to see the games and triumphs there named Olympia. And being desirous to come into this famous province, after I had traveled over all Thessaly, I happened in an evil hour to come to the city Larissa where, while I went up and down to view the streets to seek some relief for my poor condition (for I had spent all my money), I saw a tall old man standing upon a stone in the midst of the market place, crying with a loud voice and saying that if any man would watch a dead corpse that night he would be reasonably rewarded for his pains. When I heard this, I said to one who passed by, ‘What is there to do here? Are dead men accustomed to run away in this country?’ Then he answered, ‘Hold your peace, for you are but a babe and a stranger here, and not without cause are you ignorant of how things are in Thessaly. Here the women witches bite off by morsels the flesh of the faces of dead men, and thereby work their sorceries and enchantments.’ <br><br>

For these witches turn themselves into all kinds of beasts, and so deceive the eyes of all men. Sometimes they are transformed into birds, sometimes into dogs and mice, and sometimes into flies. Moreover, they will charm the keepers of the corpse asleep. Neither can it be declared what means and shifts these wicked women use to bring their purpose to pass. And the reward for such dangerous watching is no more than four or six gold coins. But hearken further (this is something I had nearly forgotten): if the keeper of the dead body does not the following morning produce the corpse as whole and sound as he received it, he shall be punished in this sort: if the corpse is diminished or spoiled in any part of his face, hands or toes, the keeper shall also be so diminished and spoiled.’ <br><br>

But beware I say, young man, that you guard well the dead corpse from the wicked witches, for he was the son of one of the chiefs of the city.’ ‘Bah,’ I said, ‘you speak what you cannot tell: behold, I am a man made all of iron, and never desire to sleep and am more quick of sight than Lyncaeus or Argus.’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.23.2#I had scarce spoken these words, when he took me by the hand and brought me to a certain house. The gate was closed fast, so that I went through the wicket, then he brought me into a chamber somewhat dark, and showed me a matron clothed in mourning vesture, and weeping in lamentably. And he spoke to her and said, ‘Behold here is one that will attempt to watch the corpse of your husband this night.’ When she heard this, she turned her sorrowful face covered with hair in my direction and said, ‘I pray you, young man, take good heed, and see well to your duty.’ ‘Have no care,’ I said , ‘that you give me anything above that which is due to be given.’ <br><br>

This done, she said these words: ‘Behold, his nose is whole, his eyes safe, his ears without scar, his lips untouched, and his chin sound.’ All of this was written and noted on tablets, and signed by the hands of witnesses to confirm the same. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.24.2#This done I said to the matron, ‘Madam I pray you that I may have all things here necessary.’ ‘What is that?’ she asked. ‘Indeed, said I, ‘a great lamp with oil, pots of wine, and water to dilute the same, and some other drink and dainty dish leftover from supper.’ Then she shook her head and said, ‘Away, fool that you are! Do you think to play the glutton here, and look for dainty foods, where for so long a time there has not been seen smoke at all? Do you come here to eat, where we should weep and lament?’ And therewith she turned back, and commanded her maiden Myrrhena to deliver me a lamp with oil. When she had done this, they closed the chamber door and departed. <br><br>

To it I said, ‘Get yourself hence you whore and take yourself to your fellows, lest you feel my fingers. Why will you not go?’ Then immediately it ran away, and when it was gone, I fell on the ground so fast asleep, such that Apollo himself could not discern which of us two was the dead corpse, for I lay prostrate as one without life, and needed a keeper likewise. <br><br>

Whereupon I awaked and, being greatly afraid, ran to the dead body with the lamp in my hand and viewed him round about. Immediately the matron came in weeping, with her witnesses, and ran to the corpse and, repeatedly kissing him, turned his body and found no part diminished. Then she told Philodespotus, her steward, to pay me my wages immediately. When he had done this, he said, ‘We thank you, gentle young man, for your pains and indeed for your diligence: hereafter we will account you as one of the family.’ To this I (being joyous of my unhoped gain, and rattling my money in my hand) answered, ‘I pray you, madam, esteem me as one of your servants, and if you want my service at any time, I am at your command.’ I had not fully declared these words, when behold, all the servants of the house were assembled with weapons to drive me away, one buffeted me about the face, another about the shoulders, some struck me in the sides, some kicked me, and some tore my garments, and so I was handled amongst them and driven from the house, as the proud young man Adonis who was torn by a boar. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.27.1#[27] “And when I had come into the next street, I mused with my self, and remembered my unwise and unadvised words which I had spoken. Thus I considered that I had deserved much more punishment, and that I was worthily beaten for my folly. And by and by the corpse came forth, which because it was the body of one of the chief of the city, was carried in funeral pomp round about the market place, according to the custom of the country there. And immediately an old man came forth weeping and lamenting, and ran to the bier and embraced it, and with deep sighs and sobs cried out in this sort, ‘O master, I pray you by the faith which you profess, and by the duty that you owe to the common good, take pity and mercy upon this dead corpse, who was miserably murdered, and do vengeance on this wicked and cursed woman, his wife, who has committed this deed. For it is she and no other who has poisoned her husband, my sister’s son, in order to maintain her whoredom, and to get his money.’ In this way the old man complained before the face of all people. Then they (astonished at these sayings, and because the thing seemed to be true) cried out, ‘Burn her, burn her,’ and they sought stones to throw at her, and willed the boys in the street to do the same. But she, weeping in lamentably, swore by all the gods, that she was not culpable of this crime. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.28.1#[28] “‘No,’ said the old man, ‘here is one sent by the providence of God to try out the matter, Zachlas an Egypptian, who is the most principal prophesier in all this country, and who was hired by me for money to bring back the soul of this man from hell, and to revive his body for a trial of this matter. And thereupon he brought forth a certain young man clothed in linen raiment, having on his feet a pair of slippers and his crown shaven. The old man kissed his hands and knees, saying, ‘O priest, have mercy, have mercy I pray the by the celestial planets, by the powers infernal, by the virtue of the natural elements, by the silences of the night, by the buildings of the swallows near to the town Coptus, by the increase of the flood of the Nile, by the secret mysteries of Memphis, and by the instruments and trumpets of the island Pharos: have mercy I say, and call again to life this dead body, and make his eyes which are closed and shut be open and see. However, we do not mean to strive against the law of death, nor do we intend to deprive the earth of his right, but in order that this deed may be known, we crave but a small time and space of life.’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.28.2#Whereupon this prophet was moved, and took a certain herb and laid it three times upon the mouth of the dead, and he took another and laid it and laid it upon his breast in like sort. When he had done this he turned to the east, and made certain prayers to the sun, which caused all the people to marvel greatly, and to look for the strange miracle that would happen. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.29.1#[29] “Then I pressed in amongst them near to the bier, and got upon a stone to see this mystery, and behold, soon the dead body began to receive spirit: his principal veins moved, his life came again, and he held up his head and spoke in this sort: ‘Why do you call me back again to this transitory life, I who have already tasted of the water of Lethe, and likewise have been in the deadly den of Styx? Leave off, I pray, leave off, and let me lie in quiet rest.’ When these words were uttered by the dead corpse, the prophet drew near the bier and said, ‘I charge you to tell before the face of all the people here the occasion of your death: What, do you think that I cannot by my conjurations call up the dead, and by my power torment your body?’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.29.2#Then the corpse moved his head again, and made reverence to the people, and said, ‘Verily I was poisoned by the means of my wicked wife, and so thereby yielded my bed to an adulterer.’ Whereupon his wife, taking present audacity and reproving his sayings, with a cursed mind denied it. The people were bent against her sundry ways, and some thought it best that she should be buried alive with her husband. But some said that no credit ought to be given to a dead body. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.30.1#[30] “This opinion was clean taken away by the words which the corpse spoke again: ‘Behold, I will give you some evident token, which never yet any other man knew, whereby you shall perceive that I declare the truth.’ And by and by he pointed towards me who stood on the stone, and said, ‘When this good guard of my body watched me diligently in the night, and the wicked witches and enchantresses came into the chamber to spoil me of my limbs, and to about their intentions had transformed themselves into the shape of beasts, and since they could in no way deceive or beguile his vigilant eyes, they cast him into so dead and sound a sleep that by their witchcraft he seemed without spirit or life. After this they called me by my name, and never stopped until the cold members of my body began by little and little and little to revive. Then he, being of more lively soul and even though he was buried in sleep, since he and I have the name, and because he did not know that they were calling me, rose up first, and as one without sense or perseverance passed through the locked door to a certain hole, where the witches cut off first his nose, and then his ears. And so that was done to him which was appointed to be done to me. And so that such their subtlety might not be perceived, they made him a like pair of ears and nose of wax. Wherefore you may see that the poor wretch, for greed of a little money, sustained loss of his members. When he had said this, I was greatly astonished, and minding to prove whether his words were true or no, put my hand to my nose, and my nose fell off, and put my hand to my ears and my ears fell off. All the people wondered greatly at this, and laughed me to scorn. But I, being stricken in a cold sweat, crept between their legs for shame and escaped away. So I, disfigured, returned home again, and covered the loss of my ears with my long hair, and glued this rag to my face to hide my shame.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.31.1#[31] As soon as Thelyphron had told his tale, those who sat at the table, replenished with wine, laughed heartily. And while they drank to one another, Byrrhena spoke to me and said, “From the first foundation of this city we have a custom to celebrate the festival day of the god Risus, and tomorrow is the feast at which I pray you to be present. In order to set out the feast more honorably, I wish with all my heart that you could find or devise some way that might be able to honor of so great a god.’ To her I answered, ‘Verily, aunt, I will do as you command me, and I would be right glad if I might invent any laughing or merry matter to please or satisfy Risus with.’ Then I rose from the table and took leave of Byrrhena and departed. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:2.32.1#[32] And when I came into the first street my torch went out, so that only with great trouble could I get home since it was so dark and for fear of stumbling. And when I was nearly at the door, behold, I saw three men of great stature, heaving and lifting at Milo's gates to get in. And when they saw me they were not afraid, but tried with more force to break down the doors, whereby they gave me occasion to think that they were strong thieves. Whereupon I by and by drew out my sword, which I carried for that purpose under my cloak, and ran in amongst them, and wounded them such that they fell down dead before my face. Thus when I had slain them all, I knocked sweating and breathing at the door till Fotis let me in. And then, full weary with the slaughter of those thieves, like Hercules when he fought against the king Geryon, I went to my chamber and went to sleep.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.1.1#[1] When morning came, and I was awaked from sleep, my heart burned sorely with the memory of the murder that I had committed the night before. I rose and sat down on the side of the bed with my legs across and, wringing my hands, I wept in most miserable fashion. For I imagined that I was brought before the judge in the judgment place, and that he awarded sentence against me, and that the hangman was ready to lead me to the gallows. And further I imagined and said to myself, “Alas what judge is there who is so gentle or benign that will think that I am not guilty of the slaughter and murder of these three men. However, the Assyrian Diophanes firmly assured me that my peregrination and voyage here should be prosperous.” But while I did thus unfold my sorrows and greatly bewail my fortune, behold I heard a great noise and cry at the door. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.2.1#[2] In came the magistrates and officers, who commanded two sergeants to bind and lead me to prison. I was willingly obedient and, as they led me through the street, all the city gathered together and followed me, and although I looked always at the ground for very shame, yet sometimes I cast my head aside, and marveled greatly that among so many thousands of people there was not one who did not laugh exceedingly. Finally, when they had brought me through all the streets of the city, like those that go in procession and make sacrifice to mitigate the ire of the gods, they placed me in the judgment hall before the seat of the judges. And after the crier had commanded all men to keep silence, the people desired the judges to give sentence in the great theater, because of the great multitude there who were in danger of stifling. And behold, the crowd of people increased still, some climbed to the top of the house, some got upon the beams, some upon the images, and some thrust their heads through the windows, little regarding the dangers they were in, so they might see me. Then the officers brought me forth openly into the middle of the hall so that every man might behold me. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.3.1#[3] And after the crier had made a noise, and ordered all those who could bring any evidence against me should come forth, there stepped forth an old man who desired to have liberty to speak for the length of time that the water-clock allowed. When this was granted, he began an oration of this sort.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.3.2#“O most reverend and just judges, the thing that I purpose to declare to you is no small matter, but concerns the condition and tranquility of this whole city, and the punishment for it may be a very good example to others. Wherefore I pray you, most venerable Fathers, to whom and to all of whom it pertains, to provide for the dignity and safety of society, such that you in no way allow this wicked murderer, soaked in the blood of so many murdered citizens, to escape unpunished. And don’t think that I am moved by envy or hatred, but by reason of my office, in that I am captain of the night watch, and because no man alive should accuse me to be remiss in my duty I will declare all the whole matter as it was done last night. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.3.3#“This night past, when, at our accustomed hour, I diligently searched every part of the city, behold, I happened to discern this cruel young man drawing out his sword against three citizens and, after a long combat had been fought between them, he murdered one after another miserably. When he had done this, moved in his conscience at so great a crime, he ran away and, aided by darkness, slipped into a house, and there lay hidden all night. But by the providence of the gods, which suffers no heinous offence to pass unpunished, he was taken by us this morning before he escaped any further, and so was brought here to your honorable presence to receive his desert accordingly.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.3.4#“So you have here a guilty person, a culpable homicide, and an accused stranger. Wherefore pronounce judgment against this man, being an alien, just as you would most severely and sharply revenge such an offence found in a known citizen.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.4.1#[4] In this sort the cruel accuser finished and ended his terrible tale. Then the crier commanded me to speak, if I had any thing to say for my self. But I could in no way utter any word at all because of my weeping. And on the other side I did not esteem so much his rigorous accusation, as I considered my own miserable conscience. However, being inspired by divine audacity, at length I began to speak: “Verily I know that it is a hard thing for him who is accused of having slain three persons to persuade you that he is innocent. Although he may declare the whole truth, and relate how the matter indeed happened, if your honors will vouchsafe to give me audience, I will show you that if I am condemned to die, I have not deserved it as my own desert, but I was moved by fortune and reasonable cause to do that deed. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.5.1#[5] “For returning somewhat late from supper last night (being well tippled with wine, a thing which I will not deny) and approaching near to my common lodging, which was in the house of one Milo a citizen of this city, I happened to discern three great thieves attempting to break down his walls and gates, and to open the locks to enter in. And when they had removed the doors off the hooks, they consulted amongst themselves as to how they would handle those they found in the house. And one of them, being of more courage and of greater stature than the rest, spoke to his fellows and said, ‘Bah, you are but boys; take men’s hearts to you, and let us enter into every part of the house, and let us kill those we find asleep, so that we shall escape without danger.’ Verily, judges, I confess that I drew out my sword against those three citizens, but I thought it was the duty of one who bears good will to this city so to do, especially since they put me in great fear, and tried to rob and spoil my friend Milo. But since those cruel and terrible men would in no case run away, nor fear my naked sword, but boldly resisted me, I ran upon them and fought valiantly. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.6.1#[6] “One of them who was the captain attacked me vigorously, and drew me by the hair with both his hands, and began to beat me with a great stone. But in the end I proved the hardier man and threw him down at my feet and killed him. I took likewise the second, who grabbed my legs and bit me, and slew him also. And the third came running violently against me and, after I had stricken him under the stomach, he fell down dead. Thus when I had delivered myself, the house, my host, and all his family from this present danger, I thought that I should not only escape unpunished, but also have some great reward from the city for my trouble. “Moreover, I, who have always been clear and unstained by crime and have esteemed my innocence above all the treasure of the world, can find no reasonable cause why, upon my accusation, I should be condemned to die. This is because, in the first place, I was moved to set upon the thieves by just cause. Secondly, because there is no one that can affirm that there has been at any time either grudge or hatred between us. Thirdly, we were mere strangers and of no acquaintance. Last of all, no man can prove that I committed that deed for greed or gain.”<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.7.1#[7] When I had ended my words in this way, behold, I wept again piteously and, holding up my hands, I prayed all the people by the mercy of the state and for the love of my poor infants and children, to show me some pity and favor. And when their hearts had somewhat relented and they were moved by my lamentable tears, I called all the gods to witness that I was not guilty of the crime, and so I committed my present condition to their divine providence. But, turning myself again, I perceived that all the people laughed exceedingly, and especially my good friend and host Milo. “Where is remorse of conscience? Behold, I am condemned to die as a murderer, for the safeguard of my host Milo and his family. Yet is he not contented with that, but likewise laughs me scornfully when he should comfort and help me.”<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.8.1#[8] When this was done, out came a woman weeping in the middle of the theater arrayed in mourning vesture and bearing a child in her arms. And after her came an old woman in ragged robes, crying and howling likewise. And they brought with them the olive boughs with which the three slain bodies were covered on the bier, and cried out in this manner: “O right judges, we pray you by your justice and humanity have mercy upon these slain persons, and succor our widowhood and loss of our dear husbands, and especially this poor infant, who is now an orphan, and deprived of all good fortune. Execute your justice by order and law upon the blood of this thief, who is the cause of all our sorrows.” When they had spoken these words, one of the most ancient judges rose and said, “Concerning this murder, which deserves great punishment, this malefactor himself cannot deny, but our duty is to enquire and try out whether he had any companions to help him. For it is not likely that one man alone could kill three such great and valiant persons. Wherefore the truth must be tried out by the rack, and so we shall learn what other companions he has, and root out the nest of these mischievous murderers.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.9.1#[9] And there was no long delay and, according to the custom of Greece, the fire, the wheel, and many other torments were brought in. Then my sorrow increased or rather doubled since I would not end my life with whole and undamaged members. And by and by the old woman, who troubled all the court with her howling, asked the judges that, before I should be tormented on the rack, I might uncover the bodies of those I had slain, so that every man might see their comely shape and youthful beauty, and so that I might receive deserved and worthy punishment according to the quality of my offence. And thereupon she made a sign of joy. Then the judge commanded me immediately to uncover the bodies of the slain who were lying upon the bier with my own hands. But when I refused, since I did not want to make my deed apparent to the eyes of men, the sergeants charged me by command of the judges and thrust me forward to do it. I, then being forced by necessity, though it was against my will, uncovered their bodies. But O good Lord, what a strange sight I saw, what a marvel! What sudden change of all my sorrows! It seemed as though I belonged to the house of Proserpina and to the family of death since I could not sufficiently express the form of this new sight, to such an extent I was amazed and astonished by it. For the bodies of the three slain men were not bodies at all, but three blown bladders mangled in diverse places, and they seemed to be wounded in those parts which I remembered I wounded the thieves in the night before. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.10.1#[10] At this the people laughed exceedingly. Some rejoiced marvelously at seeing this, some held their stomachs that were aching with mirth, but every man delighted at this joke, and so left the theater. But I from the time that I uncovered the bodies stood still, as cold as ice, not any differently than the other statues and images there. Neither did I come into my right senses until such time as Milo my host came and took me by the hand, and with civil violence led me away weeping and sobbing, whether I would go or not. And so I might not be seen, he brought me through many blind ways and lanes to his house, where he went about comforting me, since I was sad and still fearful, with gentle talk. But he could in no way mitigate the injury which I conceived within my mind. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.11.1#[11] And behold, by and by the magistrates and judges with their ensigns entered into the house, and tried to pacify me by saying, “O Lucius, we know of your dignity, and know the genealogy of your ancient lineage, for the nobility of your kin possesses the greatest part of all this province. And do not think that you have suffered something to cry about, something that causes you reproach and ignominy. But put all care and sorrow out of your mind. For this day, which we celebrate once a year in honor of the god Risus, is always renowned for some solemn joke, and the god continually accompanies butt of the joke, and will not suffer him to be sorrowful, but pleasantly to bear a joyful face. And truly all the city intends to reward you with great honors, and to make you a patron for the grace that is in you. And further, that your statue or image may be set up for a perpetual remembrance.” To them I answered, “As for such benefits as I have received from the famous city of Thessaly, I yield and render great thanks. But regarding the setting up of any statues or images, I would wish that they should be reserved for my ancestors, and those who are more worthy than me.”<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.12.1#[12] And when I had spoken these words somewhat gravely, and showed my self more merry than I was before, the judges and magistrates departed, and I reverently took my leave of them, and bid them farewell. And behold, by and by there came a man running to me in haste who said, “Sir, your Aunt Byrrhena desires you, according to your promise last night, to come to supper, for it is ready.” But I, greatly fearing to go again to her house at night, said to the messenger, “My friend, I pray you tell to my aunt, your mistress, that I would willingly be at her commandif it didn’t cause me to break my promise and credit. For my host Milo has forced me to assure him, and compelled me by the feast of this present day, that I should not depart from his company. Wherefore I pray you to excuse me, and to defer my promise to another time.”<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.12.2#And while I was speaking these words, Milo took me by the hand and led me towards the baths. But on the way I hid behind him to conceal myself from the sight of men, because I had become such an occasion for laughter. And I did not remember having washed and wiped my self or having returned home again, so greatly abashed I was at the nodding and pointing of every person. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.13.1#[13] Then I went to supper with Milo, where God knows we fared but meanly. Wherefore, feigning that my head ached by reason of my sobbing and weeping all the day, I asked leave to depart to my chamber, and so I went to bed. While I was a bed, I began to call to mind all the sorrows and grief that I suffered the day before, until such time as my love Fotis, having brought her mistress to sleep, came into the chamber. She did not appear as usual, for she seemed pleasant neither in countenance nor talk, but with sorrowful face and frowning look, she began to speak in this way: “Verily I confess that I have been the occasion of all your trouble this day.” And thereupon she pulled a whip from under her apron, and gave it to me saying, “Revenge yourself on me, mischievous harlot, or rather slay me. And don’t think that I did willingly procured this anguish and sorrow for you: I call the gods to witness. For I would rather my own body had perished, than that you should receive or sustain any harm because of me. But what I did was by the command of another, and devised, as I thought, for some other. But behold, the unlucky chance happened on you by my evil occasion.”<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.14.1#[14] Then I, very curious and desirous to know the matter, answered, “Truly, this most pestilent and evil-favored whip (that you have brought for me to scourge you), shall first be broken in a thousand pieces before touches or hurts your delicate and dainty skin. But I pray you, tell me how you were the cause of my trouble and sorrow? For I swear by the love that I bear to you that I will not be persuaded, even if you yourself should try to do so, that you ever tried to trouble or harm me. Perhaps sometimes you imagined an evil thought in your mind, which afterwards you revoked, but that is not to be deemed as a crime.” When I had spoken these words, I kissed my Fotis’ eyes which were wet with tears and well nigh closed up with desire for pleasure. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.15.1#[15] And when she was somewhat restored to happiness, she asked me that she first shut the chamber door, lest by the intemperance of her tongue in uttering any unfitting words, further trouble might arise. Wherefore she barred and propped the door and came to me again, and embracing me lovingly about the neck with both her arms, spoke with a soft voice and said, “I greatly fear to uncover the secrets of this house, and to utter the secret mysteries of my mistress. But I have such a confidence in you and in your wisdom, because you come from so noble a family and are endowed with so profound knowledge and, further, are instructed in so many holy and divine matters, that you will faithfully keep silence, and that whatever I shall reveal or declare to you, you will close them in the bottom of your heart, and never uncover them. For I ensure you that the love that I bear to you compels me to utter it. Now you shall know all the conditions of our house, now you shall know the hidden secrets of my mistress, whom the powers of hell obey, and by whom the celestial planets are troubled, the gods made weak, and the elements subdued.

urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.16.1#[16] “For now she loves a Boeotian youth, a fair and beautiful person, on whom she employs all her sorcery and enchantment. I heard her say with my own ears last night that, if the sun had not then presently gone down and the night come to provide a convenient time to work her magical enticements, she would have brought perpetual darkness over all the world herself. And you shall know that when last night she saw this Boeotian sitting at the barber’s (as she came from the baths), she secretly commanded me to gather some of his hair that lay dispersed upon the ground and to bring it home. I thought I had done this, but the barber saw me and, since it was rumored throughout the city that we were witches and enchantresses, he cried out and said, “Will you never leave off stealing young men’s hairs? Indeed I assure you, unless you cease your wicked sorceries, I will complain to the justices. Whereupon he came angrily towards me, and pulled out from between my breasts the hair that I had gathered. This grieved me very much, for I knew my mistress’ manners, and that she would not be contented but beat me cruelly. Wherefore I intended to run away, but the memory of you put always that thought out of my mind. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.17.1#[17] “And so I came home very sorrowful. But so that I would not seem to come to my mistress’ sight with empty hands, when I saw a man shearing blown goat skins, and since the hair which he had shorn off was yellow and much resembled the hair of the Boeotian, I took a good deal of it and, dissembling the matter, brought it to my mistress. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.17.2#“And so when night came, before your return from supper, she, to bring her intentions to pass, went up to a high gallery of the house that opens to the east part of the world and, preparing her self according to her accustomed practice, she gathered together all substance for fumigations. She brought forth plates of metal carved with strange characters, she prepared the bones of those who had been drowned by tempests at sea, she made ready the members of dead men (such as the nostrils and fingers), she set out the lumps of flesh of those who had been hanged, the blood which she had kept of those who had been slain, and the jaw bones and teeth of wild beasts.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.18.1#[18] “Then she spoke certain charms over the hair, and dipped it in diverse waters, as in well water, cow milk, mountain honey, and other liquids. When she had done this, she tied it up together and with many perfumes and smells threw it into a hot fire to burn. Then, by the great force of this sorcery and the power of so many confections, those bodies whose hair was burning in the fire received humane shape, and came and rapped at our doors instead of the Boeotian youth. Then you, being well tippled and deceived by the obscurity of the night, drew out your sword courageously, like furious Ajax, and killed whole herds of beasts as he did, but three blown skins, so that I, after the slaughter of so many enemies, without effusion of blood might embrace and kiss not an homicide, but an utricide.”<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.19.1#[19] Thus when I was pleasantly mocked and taunted by Fotis, I said to her, “Verily now may I, for this great deed, be numbered as Hercules who by his valiant prowess performed the twelve notable Labors, like Geryon with three bodies, and like Cerberus with three heads. For I have slain three blown goatskins. But so that I may pardon you for what you have done, the thing which I shall most earnestly desire of you is that you bring me to see and behold when your mistress goes about any sorcery or enchantment, and when she prays to the gods. For I am very desirous to learn that art and, as it seems to me, you yourself have some experience in it too. For this I know and plainly feel: that whereas I have always loathed the embraces and love of matrons, I am so stricken and subdued with your shining eyes, ruddy cheeks, glittering hair, sweet thighs, and lily white breasts that I neither have mind to go home, nor to depart hence, but esteem the pleasure which I shall have with the this night above all the joys of the world.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.20.1#[20] “Then,” she said, “O my Lucius, how willing I would be to fulfill your desire, but because she is so hated, she takes herself into solitary places and out of the presence of every person, when she intends to work her enchantments. However, I think it more important for me more to gratify your request than to fear danger to my life. And when I see an opportunity I will assuredly bring you word, so that you shall see all her enchantments. But always remember this condition, that you keep secret all such things that are done.” Thus as we reasoned together the power of Venus assailed our desires and our bodies, and so Fotis unclothed herself and came to bed, and we passed the night raging with desire. When I grew tired of her feminine charms she offered me the “boy’s gift.” Then drowsy and sleep constrained us until the day had well begun.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.21.1#[21] One day Fotis came running to me in great fear and said that her mistress, in order to work her sorceries on one whom she loved, intended the following night to transform herself into a bird and to fly wherever she pleased. Wherefore she urged me secretly to prepare myself to see this. And when midnight came she led me softly into a high chamber, and bid me look through the chink of the door. First I saw that she took of all her garments, and took out of a certain coffer many kinds of box, of the which she opened one and took the ointment contained inside on her fingers and rubbed her body with it from the sole of the foot to the crown of the head. And when she had spoken secretly with her self, having the candle in her hand, she shook the parts of her body, and behold, I perceived a plume of feathers growing. Her nose grew crooked and hard, her nails turned into claws, and so she became an owl. Then she cried and screeched like a bird of that kind and, willing to prove her force, moved herself from the ground by little and little till at last she flew quite away.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.22.1#[22] Thus by her sorcery she transformed her body into whatever shape she wanted. When I saw this I was greatly astonished and although I was enchanted by no kind of charm, I thought that I was not myself. For I was so banished from my senses and amazed in madness, and thought I dreamed while awake, that I felt my eyes to see whether I was asleep or not. But when I came to my senses, I took Fotis by the hand and moved it to my face and said, “I pray the while occasion serves that I may obtain the fruits of my desire. Grant me some of this ointment. O Fotis, I pray to you by your sweet breasts to bring it about that, in the great flames of my love, I may be turned into a bird, so will I forever be bound to you and obedient to your command.” Then said Fotis, “Will you go and deceive me now, and force me to work my own sorrow? Do you have in mind not to stay in Thessaly? If you become a bird, where shall I seek you, and when shall I see you?” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.23.1#[23] Then I answered, “God forbid that I should commit such a crime. For though I could fly in the air as an eagle, or though I were the messenger of Jupiter, yet I would have recourse to nest with you. I swear by the knot of your amiable hair that, since the time I first loved you, I never fancied any other person. Moreover it comes to my mind that, if by virtue of the ointment I shall become an owl, I will take heed that I come near to no man’s house: for how merrily these matrons would handle their lovers, if they knew that they were transformed into owls. Moreover, when they are caught anywhere, they are nailed to posts, and so they are worthily rewarded, because it is thought that they bring evil fortune on the house. But I pray you (which I had almost forgotten), tell me by what means, when I am an owl, I shall return to my original shape and become Lucius again.” “Fear not,” she said, “for my mistress has taught me the way to bring that to pass. And don’t think that she did it for any good will and favor, but only so that I might help her, and minister the remedy when she returns home. Consider, I pray you, with what frivolous trifles so marvelous a thing is wrought. By Hercules, I swear I give her nothing else but a little dill and laurel leaves in well water, which she drinks and washes her self with.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.24.1#[24] When she had spoken this, she went into the chamber and took a box out of the coffer, which I first kissed and embraced, and prayed that I might have good success in my purpose. And then I took off all my garments, and greedily thrust my hand into the box, and took out a good deal of ointment and rubbed myself with it. After I had well rubbed every part and member of my body, I hovered with my arms, and moved myself like a bird. But behold, neither feathers nor appearance of feathers appeared, but verily my hair turned rugged, and my tender skin grew tough and hard, my fingers and toes losing the number of five and were changed into hooves, and out of my rear grew a great tail. Now my face became monstrous, my nostrils wide, my lips hanging down, and my ears rugged with hair. Neither could I see any comfort of my transformation, for my members increased and I could not hold Fotis.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.25.1#[25] And so helpless (viewing every part of my poor body) I perceived that I was no bird, but a plain ass. Then I thought to blame Fotis, but being deprived of language as well as human shape, I looked upon her with my hanging lips and watery eyes. She, as soon as she saw me in such state, cried out, “Alas poor wretch that I am, I am utterly lost. My fear and haste, and the similarity of the boxes, have deceived me. But it’s alright, since an easier antidote may be obtained for this than for any other thing. For if you can get a rose and eat it, you will be delivered from the shape of an ass, and become my Lucius again. I wish I had gathered some garlands this evening past, as is my custom, then you would not continue being an ass one for even a single night. But in the morning I will seek some remedy.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.26.1#[26] Thus Fotis lamented pitifully. Although I was now a perfect ass and, instead of Lucius, a brute beast, I nevertheless retained the sense and understanding of a man. And I devised a good deal with myself, whether it was best for me to attack this mischievous and wicked harlot with my mouth, or to kick and kill her with my heels. But a better thought turned me from so rash a purpose. For I feared lest by the death of Fotis I should be deprived of all remedy and help. Then, shaking my head and dissembling my ire and taking my adversity in good part, I went into the stable to my own horse. There I found another ass of Milo’s, my sometime host, and I truly thought that my own horse (if there were any natural conscience or knowledge in brute beasts) would take pity upon me and proffer me lodging for that night. But it happened quite otherwise. For my horse and the ass agreed, as it were, to work my harm and, fearing lest I should eat up their provender, would not allow me to come near the manger, but kicked me with their heels from their food, which I my self gave them the night before. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.27.1#[27] Then I, being thus handled by them and driven away, went into a corner of the stable where I remembered their lack of courtesy and how tomorrow I would return to being Lucius by the help of a rose: then I would take revenge on my horse. I happened to see in the middle of a pillar that held up the rafters of the stable the image of the goddess Epona, which was garnished and decked round about with fair and fresh roses. Then, in hope of a quick remedy, I leaped up with my fore feet as high as I could and stretched out my neck, with my lips coveting to snatch some roses. But I went about this at a bad time, for behold, the boy to whom I gave charge of my horse came presently in and, finding me climbing upon the pillar, ran towards me fretting and said, “How long shall we suffer this wild ass, who not only eats up his fellows’ food, but also would spoil the images of the gods? Why do not I kill this lame thief and weak wretch?” And thereupon, looking about for some cudgel, he saw a pile of wood and, choosing out a crabbed truncheon, the biggest he could find. He did not stop beating of me, poor wretch, until he heard a great noise and rumbling. Then the doors of the house burst open and the neighbors shouted that there thieve about. Terrified by these developments he ran away. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.28.1#[28] Soon a troupe of thieves entered and surrounded every part of the house with weapons. And as men attempted to aid and help those who were within the doors, the thieves resisted and kept them back, for every man was armed with a sword and buckler in his hand. The glimmer of their arms yielded such light as if it had been day. Then they broke open a great chest with double locks and bolts in which all Milo’s treasure was laid, and they ransacked it. When they had done this, they packed everything up and gave everyone a portion to carry. But when they saw they had more than they could carry, and since they were loath to leave any behind, they came into the stable and took us two poor asses and my horse, and loaded us with greater trusses than we were able to bear. And when we were out of the house they followed us with great staves, and ordered one of their company to tarry behind, and bring them tidings what was done concerning the robbery. And so they beat us forward over great hills out of the way. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:3.29.1#[29] But I, what with my heavy burden and long journey, seemed hardly different from a dead ass. Wherefore I determined to seek some civil remedy and, by invocation of the name of the emperor, to be delivered from my miseries. And so at one point, as I passed through a great fair, I came among a multitude of Greeks and I decided to call upon the renowned name of the emperor and say, “O Caesar!” I cried out aloud, “O,” but “Caesar” I could not pronounce. The thieves, little regarding my crying, beat my wretched skin in such a way that afterward it was not apt even to make sieves. However at last Jupiter administered to me an unforeseen remedy. For when we had passed through many towns and villages, I happened to discern a pleasant garden in which, beside many other flowers of delectable hues, were new and fresh roses. Being very joyful and desirous to catch some as I passed by, I drew nearer and nearer. And while my lips watered upon them, I thought of a better and more profitable plan: I thought that if from an ass I should become a man, I might fall into the hands of the thieves, and either by suspicion that I was some witch, or for fear that I should reveal their theft, I would be slain. Wherefore I abstained that time from eating roses and, enduring my present adversity, I ate hay as other asses do.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.1.1#[1] When noon arrived and when the broiling heat of the sun was strongest, we turned into a village to meet certain of the thieves’ acquaintances and friends. Their greeting and embracing gave me, poor ass, to understand this. And they took the truss from my back, and gave them part of the treasure, and they seemed to whisper and tell them that it was stolen goods. After we were unloaded of our burdens, they let us loose in a meadow to pasture, but my own horse and Milo’s ass would not allow me to feed there with them, but I had to seek my dinner in some other place. Wherefore I leaped into a garden which was behind the stable and, being nearly dead with hunger and although I could find nothing there but raw and green vegetables, yet I filled my hungry guts abundantly and, praying to all the gods, I looked about in every place to see if I could spy any red roses in the gardens nearby. Being alone did put me in good hope that if I could find any remedy, I would presently be changed from an ass into Lucius out of every man’s sight. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.2.1#[2] And while I considered these things, I looked about and behold, I saw a far off a shadowed valley near a wood where amongst diverse other herbs and pleasant verdures I thought I saw bright flourishing roses of bright damask color. I said to myself, “Verily that place is the place of Venus and the Graces where secretly glistens the royal hue of so lively and delectable a flower.” Then I, asking the help of the gods, ran lustily towards the wood, so much so that I felt that I was no longer an ass but a swift racehorse. But my agility and quickness could not prevent the cruelty of my fortune for, when I came to the place, I saw that they were not roses, neither tender nor pleasant, neither moistened with the heavenly drops of dew, nor celestial liquor, which grew out of the thicket and thorns there. Neither did I perceive that there was any valley at all, but only the bank of the river, environed with great thick trees. These had long branches like laurel, and bore a flower without any manner of scent. The common people call these by the name of laurel roses, which are very poisonous to all manner of beasts. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.3.1#[3] I was at that point so entangled with unhappy fortune that I little esteemed my own danger, and went willingly to eat of these roses, though I knew them to be poisonous. As I drew near I saw a young man who seemed to be the gardener coming upon me, and when he perceived that I had devoured all his herbs in the garden, he came swearing with a great staff in his hand, and beat me in such way that I was nearly dead. But I speedily devised some remedy myself, for I lifted up my legs and kicked him with my hind heels, so that I left him lying at the hill foot nearly slain, and then I ran away. Quickly his wife came out who, seeing her husband half-dead, cried and howled in pitiful sort, and went toward her husband so that by her loud cries she might bring about my destruction. Then all the persons of the town, moved by her noise, came forth and cried for dogs to tear me down. Out came a great company of bulldogs and mastiffs, more fit to pull down bears and lions than me. When I beheld them I thought truly I would presently die. But I turned myself about and ran as fast as I could to the stable from which I came. Then the men of the town called in their dogs, and took me and bound me to the staple of a post, and scourged me with a great knotted whip till I was nearly dead. They would undoubtedly have slain me, had it not come to pass that, what with the pain of their beating and the green herbs that lay in my guts, I caught such a diarrhea that I all besprinkled their faces with my liquid dung, and forced them to leave off. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.4.1#[4] Not long after, the thieves loaded us up again, and especially me, and brought us forth from the stable. When we had gone a good part of our journey, because of the length of the trek, my great burden, the beating of staves, and my worn hooves, I was so weary that I could barely go. Then I saw before me a river running with fair water, and I said to myself, “Behold, now I have found a good opportunity. For I will fall down when I come yonder and I will not rise again, not even with scourging or with beating. For I would rather be slain there presently, than go any further.” And the reason why I determined to do this was as follows: I thought that the thieves, when they saw me so feeble and weak that I could not travel, since they would not want a delay in their journey, would take the burden from my back and put it on my fellows, and so for my further punishment to leave me as a prey to the wolves and ravening beasts. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.5.1#[5] But evil fortune prevented so good a plan. For the other ass, being of the same purpose as me, by feigned weariness fell down first with all his burden on the ground as though he were dead. He would not rise either with beating or with pricking, or stand upon his legs, though they pulled him by the tail, by his legs, and by his ears. When the thieves beheld this, as though without all hope they said one to another, “Why should we stand here so long about a dead or rather a stony ass? Let us be gone.” And so they took his burden and divided between me and my horse. And then they drew out their swords and cut off the ass’ legs, and threw his body from the point of a hill down into a great valley. Then I, considering the evil fortune of my poor companion, decided now to forget all subtlety and deceit and to play the good ass to get my masters’ favor, for I perceived by their talk that we had come nearly to our journey’s end. And after we had passed over a little hill, we came to our appointed place. When we were unloaded of our burdens, and all things carried in, I tumbled and wallowed in the dust to refresh myself instead of with water. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.6.1#[6] The matter and the time compels me to make description of the place, and especially of the den where the thieves lived. I will prove my wit in what I can do: consider whether I was an ass in judgment and sense, or not. For first there was an exceedingly high hill surrounded with big trees and with many ravines full of sharp stones, whereby it was inaccessible. There were many winding and hollow valleys, environed with thickets and thorns, and naturally fortressed round about. From the top of the hill ran a stream as clear as silver that watered all the valleys below, which seemed like an inland sea or a standing flood. In front of the den, where was no hill, stood a high tower, at the foot of which there were sheepfolds fenced and walled with clay. Before the gate of the house were paths made instead of walls. On the whole you could easily judge it to be a very den for thieves, and there was nothing else except a little hut covered with thatch, where the thieves were accustomed to stand watch nightly, as I after perceived. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.7.1#[7] And when they had all crept into the house and we were all tied fast with halters at the door, they began to chide an old woman there, crooked with age, who was in charge of all the house. They said, “How is it, old witch, old trot, and strumpet, that you sit idly all day at home and having no regard to our perilous labors? Have you provided nothing for our suppers, but sit eating and swilling yourself from morning till night?” Then the old woman trembled and, scarcely able to speak, said, “Behold, my powerful and faithful masters, you shall have food and pottage enough soon. Here is the store of bread, plenty of wine poured in clean-rinsed pots, likewise here is hot water prepared to bathe you.” When she had said this, they took off all their garments and refreshed themselves by the fire. And after they were washed and anointed with oil, they sat down at the table that had been garnished with all kind of dainty foods. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.8.1#[8] They had no sooner sat down, when another company of young men came in, more in number than was before, who seemed likewise to be thieves. For they brought in their loot gold and silver, plate, jewels, and rich robes. When they had likewise washed, they sat among the rest and served one another by order. Then they drank and ate exceedingly, laughing, crying and making much noise, such that I thought that I was among the tyrannous and wild Lapiths, Thebans, and Centaurs. At length one of them, more valiant than the rest, spoke in this way, “We indeed have valiantly conquered the house of Milo of Hypata, and beside all the riches and treasure which by force we have brought away, we have all come home safe, and are increased the more by this horse and this ass. But you, who have roved about in the country of Boeotia, have lost your valiant captain Lamachus, whose life I valued more than all the treasure that you have brought. Therefore the memory of him shall be renowned forever amongst the most noble kings and valiant captains. But you, when you go abroad, seem like men with ganders’ hearts who creep through every corner and hole for every trifle.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.9.1#[9] Then one of the latter group answered, “Why, are you ignorant of the fact that the greater the number of victims is, the easier it will be to rob and spoil the house? Although the family is dispersed in diverse lodgings, yet every man would rather defend his own life than to save the riches of his master. But when there are but a few thieves, then will they not only rather save themselves, but also their possessions, how little or great it is. So that you may believe me I will show you an example. We had arrived near Thebes, the source of our art and science, when we learned where a rich money-lender called Chryseros lived. This man, to avoid public duty, dissembled his condition and lived by himself shabbily, though possessing an abundance of treasure, and everyday went about in ragged and torn clothing. Wherefore we decided to go to his house and spoil him of all his riches. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.10.1#[10] When night came we drew towards the door, which was so strongly barred that we could neither move it nor lift it out of the hooks. We thought it best not to break it open lest by the noise we should rouse the neighbors nearby. Then our strong and valiant captain Lamachus, trusting in his own strength and force, thrust in his hand through a hole in the door, intending to pull back the bolt. But the covetous wretch Chryseros, being awake and making no noise, came softly to the door and caught his hand and with a great nail nailed it to the doorpost. When he had done this, he ran up to the high chamber and called everyone of his neighbors by name, asking them to succor him with all possible speed, saying that his own house was on fire. Then every one, fearing for himself, came running out to aid him.<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.11.1#[11] Wherewith we, fearing our present peril, were unsure as to what was best to do, whether we should leave our companion there, or yield ourselves to die with him. But we by his consent devised a better way, for we cut off his arm by the elbow and let it hang there. Then we bound his wound with cloths, lest we should be traced by the drops of blood. This done, we took Lamachus and led him away, for fear we would be captured. But we were so closely pursued that we were in immediate danger, and Lamachus could not keep our company by reason of faintness. And for his part, perceiving that it was not for his profit to linger behind, he spoke to us as a man of singular courage and virtue, imploring us by much entreaty and prayer and by the power of the god Mars, and by the faith of our confederacy, to deliver his body from torment and miserable captivity. And further he said, “How is it possible that so courageous a captain as I can live without his hand, with which I once robbed and slew so many people? I would think myself sufficiently happy if I could be slain by one of you.” But when he saw that we all refused to commit any such deed, he drew out his sword with his other hand and, after he kissed it many times, he drove it clean through his body. Then we honored the corpse of so powerful a man, and wrapped it in linen clothes and threw it into the sea. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.12.1#[12] So lies our master Lamachus, buried in a grave of water. He ended his life as I have declared. But Alcimus, though he was a man of great enterprise, yet he could not beware by Lamachus, nor void himself from evil fortune. One day, when he had entered into an old woman’s house to rob her, he went up into a high chamber where he should first have strangled her. But he had more concern to throw down the bags of money and gold out at a window to those of us who stood underneath. And since he was so greedy that he would leave nothing behind, he went into the old woman’s bed where she lay asleep, and would have taken off the coverlet and thrown it down likewise, but she woke up, and kneeling on her knees, begged him in this manner: “O sir I pray you not to cast away such torn and ragged cloths into my neighbors’ houses, for they are rich enough, and need no such things.” Then Alcimus, thinking her words to be true, was deceived into believing that the things he had thrown out already, and the things he was going throw out after, had not fallen down to his fellows, but into other men’s houses. Wherefore he went to the window to see the places round about, thrusting his body out of the window. The old woman marked him well, and came behind him softly, and though she had but small strength, yet with sudden force she took him by the heels and thrust him out headlong, and so he fell upon a marvelous great stone and burst his ribs. As a result he vomited and spewed great clots of blood and presently died. Then we threw him to the river likewise, as we had done Lamachus before. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.13.1#[13] Since we had thus lost two of our companions, we left Thebes and marched towards the next city called Plataea, where we found a man of great fame called Demochares, who intended to put on a great festival in which there would be a trial of all kind of weapons. He came from a good house, was marvelous rich, liberal, and well-deserved that which he had. He had prepared many shows and pleasures for the common people such that there is no man who can either by wit or eloquence show in words his worthy preparations. First he had provided all sorts of arms and he greatly delighted in hunting and chasing. He made many places to chase and encounter in. He had ready a great number of men and wild beasts, and many condemned persons were brought from the judgment place to try and fight with those beasts. But amongst so great preparations of noble price, he bestowed the most part of his patrimony in buying bears, which he nourished to his great cost, and esteemed more than all the other beasts, which either by chasing he caught himself, or which he dearly bought, or which were given to him by his many friends. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.14.1#[14] However, for all this sumptuous cost, he could not be free from the malicious eyes of envy, for some of the bears were nearly dead from being confined too long, some were weak because of the broiling heat of the sun, some languished in inactivity, but all, having various diseases, were so afflicted that they died one after another. There was nearly none left; indeed you might see them lying in the streets piteously dead. And the common people, having no other meat to feed on and little regarding any curiosity, would come forth and fill their bellies with the flesh of the bears. Then by and by Eubulus and I devised a pretty sport: we drew one of the greatest of the dead bears to our lodging, as though we were going to eat it. We stripped it of its skin, and kept his nails whole, but we did not meddle with the head, but cut it off by the neck, and so let it hang to the skin. Then we scraped off the flesh from the neck, and cast dust on it, and set it in the sun to dry. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.14.2#While the skin was a drying we made merry with the flesh, and then we devised that one of us, being more valiant than the rest both in body and courage (so that he would consent to the plan), should put on the skin and, pretending that he was a bear, should be led to Demochares’ house in the night. By this means we thought we could be let into the house. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.15.1#[15] Many were desirous to play the bear, but one Thrasyleon, a man of a courageous mind, especially wanted to take this enterprise in hand. And so we put him into the bear’s skin, which fit him finely in every point. We buckled it fast under his belly, and covered the seam with the hair so that it might not be seen. After this we made little holes through the bear’s head, and through his nostrils and eyes so Thrasyleon could see and breathe. In this way he seemed a very lively and natural beast. When this was done we went into a cave which we used for the purpose, and he crept in after bravely like a bear. Thus we began our subtlety, and we schemed as follows. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.16.1#[16] We feigned letters as though they came from one Nicanor, who dwelt in the country of Thrace and who was of great acquaintance with this Demochares. In them we wrote that he had sent him, being his friend, the first fruits of his hunting. When night had come, which was a convenient time for our purpose, we brought Thrasyleon and our forged letters and presented them to Demochares. When Demochares beheld this mighty bear, and saw the liberality of Nicanor his friend, he commanded his servants to deliver to us ten gold coins (he had a great store of these in his coffers). Then (as the novelty of a thing is accustomed to stir men’s minds to behold it) many persons came on every side to see this bear. But Thrasyleon, lest they should by curious viewing and prying perceive the truth, ran upon them to put them in fear so that they not come near. The people said, “Verily Demochares is right happy in that after the death of so many beasts, he has gotten, in spite of fortune’s head, so goodly a bear.” Then Demochares commanded that he should be put with all care in the park with all the other beasts. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.17.1#[17] But immediately I spoke to him and said, “Sir I pray you, consider that you are putting a beast, tired with the heat of the sun and with long travel, among others which, as I hear, have many maladies and diseases. Let him rather lie in some open place in your house near some water, where he may take air and ease himself. Do you not know that such beasts greatly delight in resting under the shadow of trees and hillocks near pleasant wells and waters?” Demochares was admonished by this and, remembering how many bears had perished before, was contented that we should put the bear where we would. Moreover, we said to him that we ourselves were determined to lie all night near the bear and look after him, and to give him food and drink at his due hour. Then he answered, “Verily, masters, you need not put yourselves to such pains, for I have men who do nothing else but that.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.18.1#[18] So we took leave of him and departed. When we got outside the gates of the town, we perceived before us a great tomb standing away from the road in a privy and secret place, and we went up to it and opened its entrance. We found that the sides of it were covered with the corruption of man, and the ashes and dust of his long buried body. We went inside to bring our purpose to pass and, having respect to the dark time of night, as is our custom, when we thought that every one was asleep, we went with our weapons and besieged the house of Demochares. Then Thrasyleon was ready at hand, and leaped out of the cavern, and went to kill all those he found asleep. But when he came to the porter, he opened the gates and let us in, and then he showed us a large counter, in which we saw the night before a great abundance of treasure. When we had forced it open, I bid every one of my fellows take as much gold and silver as they could carry away and bear it to the tomb. As they carried it away I stood at the gate, watching diligently when they would return. The bear ran about the house in order to frighten those family members who happened to wake up and come out. For who is he that is so powerful and courageous that, at the ugly sight of so great a monster, he will not be afraid and keep to his chamber, especially in the night? <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.19.1#[19] But when things seemed to be going so well, something unfortunate happened: for as I looked for my companions who were returning from the tomb, behold, there was a boy of the house who happened to look out of a window and saw the bear running about. Then he went and told all the servants of the house. Whereupon they quickly came forth with torches, lanterns, and other lights so that they might see all over the yard. They came with clubs, spears, naked swords, greyhounds, and mastiffs, in order to slay the poor beast. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.20.1#[20] Then I, during this confusion, was going to run away, but because I desired see Thrasyleon fight with the dogs, I lay behind the gate to watch him. Although he was pretty much doomed, nevertheless he remembered his own faithfulness and ours, and valiantly resisted the gaping and ravenous mouths of the hell hounds. So he took in earnest the role that willingly he took in hand himself, and with much ado tumbled at length out of the house. But although he seemed to have gotten away, yet he could not save himself, for all the dogs of the street joined the greyhounds and mastiffs of the house, and came upon him. Alas, what a pitiful sight it was to see our poor Thrasyleon thus surrounded by so many dogs who tore and rent him miserably. Then I, impatient of so great a misery, ran in among the press of people and, aiding him with my words as much as I could, exhorted them all in this manner: “O great and extreme misfortune, what a precious and excellent beast have we lost.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.21.1#[21] But my words accomplished nothing, for there came out a tall man with a spear in his hand who thrust Thrasyleon clean through, and afterwards many of those who stood by drew out their swords, and so they killed him. But indeed our good captain Thrasyleon, the honor of our comfort, received his death so steadfastly that he did not betray the league between us, either by crying, howling, or any other means. But, being torn by dogs and wounded with weapons, he gave forth a doleful cry, more like a beast than a man. And taking his present fortune in good part, with courage and glory enough he finished his life, with such a terror to the assembly that no person was brave enough, until it was day, to touch him even though he was stark dead. But at last there came a butcher, more valiant than the rest, who opened the paunch of the beast and slit out a hardy and adventurous thief. In this manner we lost our captain Thrasyleon, but he did not diminish his fame and honor. When this was done we packed up our treasure (which we had hidden in the tomb) and got out of Plataea, thinking to ourselves that there was more fidelity amongst the dead than amongst the living, since our prize had been so safely kept in the tomb. So, being wearied with the weight of our burdens, and very tired with long travel, and having lost three of our soldiers, we are come home with these present spoils.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.22.1#[22] Thus when they had spoken in memory of their slain companions, they took cups of gold, and sung hymns to the god Mars, and laid themselves down to sleep. Then the old woman gave us fresh barley without measure, such that my horse fed so abundantly that he might well have thought he was at some banquet that day. But I, who was accustomed to eat bran and flour, thought that it was a poor kind of meal. Wherefore I, espying a corner where lay loaves of bread for all the house, went and filled my hungry guts with the bread. When night had come the thieves awaked and rose up, and when they had buckled on their weapons and disguised their faces, they departed. And yet for all weariness I felt, I could in no way stop eating. Whereas when I was a man I could be contented with one or two loaves at the most, now my guts were so greedy that three panniers full would scarcely satisfy me. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.23.1#[23] And while I considered these things the morning came and I, being led to a river, and notwithstanding my ass-like shame, quenched my thirst. And suddenly after the thieves returned home full of care, bringing no burdens with them, not even  a cheap rag or baggage, but only a maiden who seemed by her carriage to be some gentlewoman, and the daughter of some worthy matron of that country. She was so fair and beautiful, that, though I was an ass, yet I had a great affection for her. The virgin lamented and tore her hair, and rent her garments because of the great sorrow she was in. But the thieves brought her into the cave and tried to comfort in this way, “Weep not, fair gentlewoman, we pray you. For be assured that we will do no outrage or violence to your person. But be patient a while for our profit, for necessity and poor condition has compelled us to abduct you. We warrant you that your parents, although they are greedy, will be contented to give us a great quantity of money to redeem and ransom you from our hands.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.24.1#[24] With such flattering words they endeavored to appease the gentlewoman. However, she would in no way be comforted, but put her head betwixt her knees, and cried piteously. Then they called the old woman and commanded her to sit by the maiden and pacify her grief as well as she could. Then they departed for robbery, as they were accustomed to do. But the virgin would not assuage her grief, nor mitigate her sorrow by any entreaty of the old woman, but howled and sobbed so much that she made me, poor ass, likewise weep. And thus she said, “Alas, can I, poor wench, live any longer? I who have come of so good a house, who am forsaken of my parents, friends, and family, made a rapine and prey, closed slavishly in this stony prison, deprived of all pleasure? Can I, who have been brought here, thrown into danger, ready to be rent in pieces among so many sturdy thieves and dreadful robbers, cease from weeping and live any longer?” Thus she cried and lamented, and after she had wearied herself with sorrow and worn out her face with tears, she closed the windows of her hollow eyes and laid herself down to sleep. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.25.1#[25] And after she had slept, she rose again like a furious and mad woman, and beat her breast and comely face more that she did before. Then the old woman enquired the causes of her new and sudden lamentation. The maiden, sighing in pitiful sort, answered her: “Alas, now I am utterly undone, now am I out of all hope! O give me a knife to kill me, or a halter to hang me.” at this the old woman became angry and harshly commanded her to tell her the cause of her sorrow and why, after her sleep, she should renew her grief and miserable weeping. She said: “What, do you intend to deprive our young men of the price of your ransom? No, no! Cease your crying, for the thieves little esteem your howling. And if you do not, I will surely burn you alive.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.26.1#[26] At this the maiden was greatly afraid, and kissed her hand and said, “O mother, take pity on me and my wretched fortune, and give me license a while to speak, for I think I shall not long live. Let there be mercy ripe and true in your venerable white head, and hear the sum of my calamity. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.26.2#“There was a handsome young man, who for his bounty and grace was beloved entirely by all the town, my cousin, and but three years older than I; we two were nourished and brought up in one house, lay under one roof, and in one chamber, and at length by promise of marriage, and by consent of our parents we were contracted together. The marriage day was come, the house was garnished with laurel, and torches were set in every place in the honor of Hymeneus, my espouse was accompanied by his parents, kinsfolk, and friends, and made sacrifices in the temples and public places. And when my unhappy mother pampered me in her lap, and decked me like a bride, kissing me sweetly, and making me a parent for children, behold there came in a great multitude of thieves armed like men of war, with naked swords in their hands, who went not about to do any harm, neither to take any thing away, but broke into the chamber where I was, and violently took me out of my mother’s arms, when none of our family would resist for fear. In this sort was our marriage disturbed, like the marriage of Atthis and Protesilaus. <br><br>

By the terror of which sight, and the fear of so dreadful a dream, I awaked.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.27.2#Then the old woman rendering out like sighs, began to speak in this sort: “My daughter take a good heart to you, and bee not afraid at feigned and strange visions and dreams, for as the visions of the day are accounted false and untrue, so the visions of the night do often change contrary. And to dream of weeping, beating, and killing, is a token of good luck and prosperous change. Whereas to dream of laughing, carnal dalliance, and good cheer, is a sign of sadness, sickness, loss of substance, and displeasure. But I will tell you a pleasant tale, to put away all your sorrow, and to revive your spirits.” And so she began in this manner. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.28.1#[28] THE TALE OF CUPID AND PSYCHE “There was sometimes a certain king, inhabiting in the west parts, who had to wife a noble dame, by whom he had three daughters exceeding fair: of whom the two elder were of such comely shape and beauty, as they did excel and pass all other women living, whereby they were thought worthily to deserve the praise and commendation of every person, and deservedly to be preferred above the residue of the common sort. Yet the singular passing beauty and maidenly majesty of the youngest daughter did so far surmount and excel the other two, as no earthly creature could by any means sufficiently express or set out the same. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.28.2#“By reason whereof, after the fame of this excellent maiden was spread about in every part of the city, the citizens and strangers there being inwardly pricked by the zealous affection to behold her famous person, came daily by thousands, hundreds, and scores, to her father’s palace, who was astonished with admiration of her incomparable beauty, did no less worship and reverence her with crosses, signs, and tokens, and other divine adorations, according to the custom of the old used rites and ceremonies, than if she were the Lady Venus indeed, and shortly after the fame was spread into the next cities and bordering regions, that the goddess whom the deep seas had born and brought forth, and the froth of the waves had nourished, to the intent to show her high magnificence and divine power on earth, to such as once did honor and worship her, was now conversant among mortal men, or else that the earth and not the sea, by a new concourse and influence of the celestial planets, had budded and yielded forth a new Venus, endued with the flower of virginity. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.29.1#[29] So daily more and more increased this opinion, and now is her flying fame dispersed into the next island, and well nigh to every part and province of the whole world. Whereupon innumerable strangers came from far countries, adventuring themselves by long journeys on land and by great perils on water, to behold this glorious virgin. By occasion whereof such a contempt grew towards the goddess Venus, that no person traveled to the town Paphos, nor to the Isle Cnidos, nor to Cythera to worship her. Her ornaments were thrown out, her temples defaced, her pillows and cushions torn, her ceremonies neglected, her images and statues uncrowned, and her bare altars unswept and foul with the ashes of old burnt sacrifice. For every person honored and worshipped this maiden in stead of Venus, and in the morning at her first coming abroad offered to her oblations, provided banquets, called her by the name of Venus, who was not Venus indeed, and in her honor presented flowers and garlands in most reverend fashion. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.29.2#This sudden change and alteration of celestial honor, did greatly inflame and kindle the heart of very Venus, who, unable to temper her self from indignation, shaking her head in raging sort, reasoned with her self in this manner: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.30.1#[30] “Behold the original parent of all these elements, behold the Lady Venus renowned throughout all the world, with whom a mortal maiden is joined now as partaker of honor: my name registered in the city of heaven is profaned and made vile by earthly absurdities. If I shall suffer any mortal creature to present my Majesty on earth, or that any shall bear about a false surmised shape of her person, then in vain did Paris the shepherd (in whose judgment and competence the great Jupiter had confidence) prefer me above the residue of the goddesses, for the excellence of my beauty: but she, whatever she be that has usurped my honor, shall shortly repent her of her unlawful condition.” And by and by she called her winged son Cupid, rash enough and hardy, who by his evil manners despising all public justice and law, armed with fire and arrows, running up and down in the nights from house to house, and corrupting the lawful marriages of every person, does nothing but that which is evil…<br><br> 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.31.1#[31] …who, although that he were of his own proper nature sufficiently prone to work mischief, yet she egged him forward with words and brought him to the city, and showed him Psyche (for so the maid was called) and having told the cause of her anger, not without great rage, said: “‘I pray you my dear child, by motherly bond of love, by the sweet wounds of your piercing darts, by the pleasant heat of your fire, revenge the injury which is done to your mother by the false and disobedient beauty of a mortal maiden, and I pray you, that without delay she may fall in love with the most miserable creature living, the most poor, the most crooked, and the most vile, that there may be none found in all the world of like wretchedness.’ <br><br> 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.31.2#When she had spoken these words she embraced and kissed her son, and took her voyage toward the sea. “When she came upon the sea she began to call the gods and goddesses, who were obedient at her voice. For incontinent came the daughters of Nereus, singing with tunes melodiously: Portunus with his bristled and rough beard, Salicia with her bosom full of fish, Palaemon the driver of the dolphin, the trumpeters of Triton, leaping hither and thither, and blowing with heavenly noise: such was the company which followed Venus, marching towards the ocean sea. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.32.1#[32] “In the meantime Psyche, with all her beauty, received no fruit of honor. She was wondered at of all, she was praised of all, but she perceived that no king nor prince, nor any one of the superior sort did repair to woo her. Every one marveled at her divine beauty, as it were some image well painted and set out. Her other two sisters, who were not so greatly exalted by the people, were royally married to two kings: but the virgin Psyche, sitting alone at home, lamented her solitary life, and being disquieted both in mind and body, although she pleased all the world, yet hated she in her self her own beauty. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.32.2#Whereupon the miserable father of this unfortunate daughter, suspecting that the gods and powers of heaven did envy her condition, went to the town called Miletus to receive the Oracle of Apollo, where he made his prayers and offered sacrifice, and desired a husband for his daughter. But Apollo, though he was a Greek, and of the country of Ionia, because of the foundation of Miletus, yet he gave answer in Latin verse, the sense whereof was this:<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:4.33.1#[33] “‘Let Psyche’s body be clad in mourning wed,<br> And set on rock of yonder hill aloft:<br> Her husband is no being of human seed,<br> But serpent dire and fierce as might be thought.<br> Who flies with wings above in starry skies,<br> And doth subdue each thing with fiery flight.<br> The gods themselves, and powers that seem so wise,<br> With mighty Jove, be subject to his might,<br> The rivers black, and deadly floods of pain<br> And darkness eke, as thrall to him remain.’<br><br> “the king, before happy, when he heard the prophecy of Apollo, returned home sad and sorrowful, and declared to his wife the miserable and unhappy fate of his daughter. Then they began to lament and weep, and passed over many days in great sorrow. But now the time approached of Psyche’s marriage, preparation was made, black torches were lighted, the pleasant songs were turned into pitiful cries, the melody of Hymeneus was ended with deadly howling, the maid that should be married did wipe her eyes with her veil. All the family and people of the city wept likewise, and with great lamentation was ordained a remiss time for that day, <br><br>

And when the solemnity was ended, they went to bring the sorrowful spouse, not to her marriage, but to her final end and burial. And while the father and mother of Psyche did go forward weeping and crying to this enterprise, Psyches spoke to them in this sort: ‘Why torment your unhappy age with continual grief? Why trouble you your spirits, which are more rather mine than yours? Why do you soil your faces with tears, which I ought to adore and worship? Why do you grieve my eyes in yours? why pull you your white hairs? Why do you beat your breasts for me? Now you see the reward of my excellent beauty: now, now you perceive, but too late, the plague of envy. When the people did honor me, and call me new Venus, then you should have wept, then you should have sorrowed as though I had been dead: for now I see and perceive that I have come to this misery by the only name of Venus. Bring me, and as fortune has appointed, place me on the top of the rock, I greatly desire to end my marriage, I greatly covet to see my husband. Why do I delay? why should I refuse him who is appointed to destroy all the world.’ <br><br>

And when she had refreshed herself sufficiently with sleep, she rose with a more quiet and pacified mind, and happened to spy a pleasant wood containing with great and mighty trees. She saw likewise a running river as clear as crystal: in the midst of the wood near the fall of the river was a princely edifice, wrought and built not by the art or hand of man, but by the mighty power of the gods. And you would upon first entering it that it was some pleasant and worthy mansion for the powers of heaven. For the ceilings above were of citron and ivory, propped and supported with pillars of gold, the walls covered and sealed with silver, various sorts of beasts were engraved and carved and seemed to greet those who entered. All things were so curiously and finely wrought that it seemed either to be the work of some demigod, or of some god himself. The pavement was all of precious stones, divided and cut one from another, whereon were carved various kinds of pictures. Indeed blessed and thrice blessed were those who might go upon such a pavement. Every part of the house was so well adorned that, by reason of the precious stones and inestimable treasure there, it glittered and shone as though the chambers, porches, and doors gave forth light like the sun. Neither did the other treasure of the house disagree with so great a majesty, and verily it seemed in every point a heavenly palace, fabricated and built for Jupiter himself. <br><br>

She saw storehouses wrought exceedingly fine, and filled with abundance of riches. Finally, nothing could be devised which was lacking there. But among such a great store of treasure the most marvelous thing was that there was no closure, bolt, nor lock to keep it. And when with great pleasure she had viewed all these things, she heard a voice without a body that said, ‘Why do you marvel, madam, at such great riches? Behold, all that you see is at your command. Wherefore go into the chamber and repose your self upon the bed, and desire what bath you will have. We whose voices you hear are your servants and are ready to minister to you according to your desire. In the meantime, royal foods and dainty dishes shall be prepared for you.’ <br><br>

This done, she saw the table garnished with foods, and a chair to sit down on. When Psyche sat down, all sorts of divine foods and wines were brought in, not by any body but, as it were with a wind, for she saw no person before her, but only heard voices on every side. After that all the courses were brought to the table, one came in and sung invisibly, another played on the harp, but she saw no man. The harmony of the instruments so greatly shrilled in her ears that, though there was no manner of person there, yet she seemed to be in the midst of a multitude of people. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.4.1#[4] “With all these pleasures finished, when night approached Psyche went to bed, and when she lay down and sweet sleep came upon her, she greatly feared her virginity because she was alone. Then came her unknown husband and lay with her. And after he had made a perfect consummation of the marriage, he rose in the morning before day and departed. Soon after came her invisible servants, and presented to her such things as were necessary for her defloration. And thus she passed a great deal of time and, as it happened, the strangeness of the place became increasingly pleasurable. The sound of the instruments was an especial comfort to her, being alone. During this time that Psyche was in this place of pleasures, her father and mother did nothing but weep and lament, and her two sisters, hearing of her most miserable fortune, came with great grief and sorrow to comfort and speak with her parents. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.5.1#[5] “The night following, Psyche’s husband spoke to her (for she could feel his eyes, his hands, and his ears) and said, ‘O my sweet spouse and dear wife, fortune menaces imminent danger, and so I wish you greatly to beware. Know that your sisters, thinking that you are dead, are greatly troubled, and are coming to the mountain by your steps. If you happen to hear their lamentations, beware that you in no way make answer, or look up towards them, for if you do, you shall purchase to me great sorrow, and to yourself utter destruction.’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.5.2#Psyche, hearing her husband, was contented to do all things as he had commanded. After he had departed and the night passed away, Psyche lamented and lamented all the day following, thinking that now she was past all hopes of comfort, in that she was closed within the walls of a prison, deprived of human conversation, and commanded not to aid her sorrowful sisters, nor once to see them. Thus she passed all the day in weeping, and went to bed at night, without any refection of food or bath. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.6.1#[6] “Soon afterwards came her husband who, when he had embraced her sweetly, began to say, ‘Is it thus that I find you perform your promise, my sweet wife? What do I find here? Will you pass all the day and the night in weeping? And will you not cease in your husbands arms? Go too, do what you will, purchase your own destruction, and when you find it so, then remember my words, and repent but too late.’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.6.2#Then she asked her husband more and more, assuring him that she would die unless he would grant that she might see her sisters, whereby she might speak with them and comfort them. At length he consented, and moreover he willed that she should give them as much gold and jewels as she would. But he gave her a further charge saying, ‘Beware that you covet not (being moved by the pernicious counsel of you sisters) to see the shape of my person, lest by your curiosity you deprive yourself of so great and worthy a situation.’ Psyche, being glad, rendered to him most entire thanks, and said, ‘Sweet husband, I would rather die than be separated from you for, whosoever you are, I love and retain you within my heart, as if you were my own spirit or Cupid himself. But I pray you grant this likewise, that you command your servant Zephyrus to bring my sisters down into the valley as he brought me.’ Wherewith she kissed him sweetly, and asked him gently to grant her request, calling him her spouse, her sweetheart, her joy and her solace. Whereby she persuaded him to agree to her plan, and when morning came he departed away. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.7.1#[7] “After a long search, the sisters of Psyche came to the hill where she had been set on the rock, and cried with a loud voice in such sort that the stones answered again. And when they called their sister by her name, such that their lamentable cries came to her ears, she came forth and said, ‘Behold, here is she for whom you weep. I pray you torment yourselves no more, cease your weeping.’ And by and by she commanded Zephyrus by the appointment of her husband to bring them down. Neither did he delay, for with gentle blasts he retained them up and laid them softly in the valley. I am not able to express the continual embracing, kissing and greeting which was between the three, and all sorrows and tears were then laid apart. ‘Come in,’ said Psyche, ‘into our house, and refresh your afflicted minds with your sister.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.8.1#[8] “After this she showed them the storehouses of treasure, she caused them to hear the voices which served her. The bath was ready, the foods were brought in, and when they had filled themselves with divine delicacies, the sisters conceived great envy within their hearts. One of them, being curious, demanded who her husband was, of what condition, and who was lord of so precious a house? But Psyche, remembering the promise which she had made to her husband, feigned that he was a young man, of comely stature, with a flaxen beard, and had great delight in hunting the dales and hills by. And lest by her long talk she should be found to trip or fail in her words, she filled their laps with gold, silver, and jewels, and commanded Zephyrus to carry them away. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.9.1#[9] “When they were brought up to the mountain, they made their ways homeward to their own houses, and murmured with envy that they bore against Psyche, saying, ‘Behold cruel and contrary fortune, behold how we, born all of one parent, have different destinies. But especially we who are the elder two are married to strange husbands, made as handmaidens and, as it were, banished from our country and friends. Whereas our younger sister has great abundance of treasure, and has gotten a god to her husband, although she has no skill how to use such great amounts of riches. Did you not see, sister, what was in the house, what great store of jewels, what glittering robes, what gems, what gold we trod on? If she has a husband as she affirms, there is no one who lives this day happier in all the world than she. And so it may come to pass, at length for the great affection which he bears for her, that he may make her a goddess. For, by Hercules, such was her countenance, so she behaved herself, that as a goddess she had voices to serve her, and the winds obeyed her. But I, poor wretch, have first married a husband older than my father, more bald than a coot, weaker than a child, who locks me up all day in the house.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.10.1#[10] “Then the other sister said, ‘And indeed I am married to a husband who has gout, is twofaced, crooked, nor courageous in paying my debt. I have to rub and mollify his stony fingers with diverse sorts of oils, and wrap them in plasters and salves, so that I soil my white and dainty hands with the corruption of filthy cloths, not using myself like a wife, but more like a servant. And you, my sister, seem likewise to be in bondage and servitude. Wherefore I cannot abide to see our younger sister in such felicity. Did you not see, I pray, you how proudly and arrogantly she handled us even now? And how in vaunting herself she uttered her presumptuous mind, how she cast a little gold into our laps and, being weary of our company, commanded that we should be borne away? Verily I live not, nor am a woman, until I deprive her of all her bliss. And if you, my sister, are so far bent as I, let us consult together, and not utter our mind to any person, not even to our parents, nor admit that we ever saw her. For it suffices that we have seen her, whom it repents to have seen. Neither let us declare her good fortune to our father, nor to any other, since they seem unhappy whose riches are unknown. So shall she know that she has sisters who are not abject, but worthier than she. But now let us go home to our husbands and poor houses and, when we are better instructed, let us return to suppress her pride.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.11.1#[11] “So this evil counsel pleased these two evil women, and they hid the treasure which Psyche gave them, and tore their hair, renewing their false and forged tears. When their father and mother saw them weeping and lamenting still, they doubled their own sorrows and grief. But full of ire and forced with envy, the sisters took their voyage homeward, devising the slaughter and destruction of their sister. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.11.2#In the meantime the husband of Psyche warned her again at night with these words: ‘Do you not see,’ said he, ‘what peril and danger evil fortune threatens to you, such that if you do not take good heed it will shortly come upon you. For those unfaithful harlots greatly endeavor to set their snares to catch you, and their purpose is to make and persuade you to behold my face, which, if you once happen to see, as I have often told, you shall see no more. Wherefore, if these naughty hags, armed with wicked minds, happen to come here again (as I think they will) take heed that you talk not with them but simply suffer them to speak what they will. However, if you can not restrain yourself, beware that you make no conversation about your husband, nor answer a word if they happen to ask about me. So will we increase our stock, and this young and tender child, couched in this young and tender belly of yours, shall be made an immortal god. If you err, he will be a mortal creature.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.12.1#[12] “Then Psyche was very glad that she should bring forth a divine babe, and very joyful in that she should be honored as a mother. She reckoned and numbered carefully the days and months that passed and, being never with child before, did marvel greatly that in so short a time her belly could swell so big. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.12.2#But those pestilent and wicked furies, breathing out their serpentine poison, took shipping to bring their enterprise to pass. Then Psyche was warned again by her husband in this way: ‘Behold the last day, the extreme case, and the enemies of your blood, have armed themselves against us, pitched their camp, set their host in array, and are marching towards us. For now your two sisters have drawn their swords and are ready to slay you. O with what force are we assailed on this day! O sweet Psyche, I pray you to take pity on yourself, on me, and deliver your husband and this infant within your belly from so great danger. Don’t see or hear these cursed women who are not worthy to be called your sisters, because of their great hatred and breach of sisterly amity. They will come like Sirens to the mountains, and yield out their piteous and lamentable cries.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.13.1#[13] “When Psyche had heard these words she sighed sorrowfully and said, ‘O dear husband, for a long time have you have had experience and trial of my faith. Don’t doubt that I will persevere in it. Wherefore command your wind Zephyrus that he may do as he has done before so that, although you have charged me not to behold your venerable face, yet I may comfort myself with the sight of my sisters. I pray you by these beautiful hairs, by these round cheeks delicate and tender, by your pleasant hot breast, whose shape and face I shall learn at length by the child in my belly, grant the fruit of my desire, refresh your dear spouse Psyche with joy, who is bound and linked to you for ever. I little esteem to see your visage and figure, little do I regard the night and darkness thereof, for you are my only light.’ Her husband, being as it were enchanted with these words and compelled by violence of her frequent embracing, wiped away her tears with his hair and yielded to his wife. And when morning came, departed as he was accustomed to do. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.14.1#[14] “Now her sisters arrived on land and never rested till they came to the rock. Without visiting their parents they leapt down rashly from the hill themselves. Then Zephyrus according to the divine command brought them down, although it was against his will, and laid them in the valley without any harm. By and by they went into the palace of their sister without leave, and when they had again embraced their prey and thanked her with flattering words for the treasure which she gave them, they said, ‘O dear sister Psyche, know that you are now no more a child, but a mother. O what great joy you bear to us in your belly! What a comfort will it be to all the house! How happy shall we be, who shall see this infant nourished amongst so great plenty of treasure? If he is like his parents, as it is necessary he should, there is no doubt that a new Cupid shall be born.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.15.1#[15] “By these measures they went about to win Psyche by little and little. But because they were weary with travel, they sat down in chairs, and after they had washed their bodies in bath they went into a parlor, where all kinds of foods were ready prepared. Psyche commanded one to play his harp, it was done. Then immediately others sang, and others tuned their instruments, but no person was seen. By their sweet harmony and modulation the sisters of Psyche were greatly delighted. However the wickedness of these cursed women was in no way suppressed by the sweet noise of these instruments, and they settled themselves to work their treasons against Psyche, demanding who was her husband, and of what parentage. Then she, having forgotten by too much simplicity what she had spoken before of her husband, invented a new answer, and said that her husband was of a great province, a merchant, and a man of middle age, having his beard interspersed with grey hairs. When she had spoken this (because she would have no further talk) she filled their laps with gold and silver, and bid Zephyrus to bear them away. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.16.1#[16] “On their return homeward they murmured within themselves, saying, ‘What do you say, sister, to so apparent a lie of Psyche? First she said that her husband was a young man of flourishing years, and had a flaxen beard, and now she says that he is half grey with age. Who is he that in so short a space can become so old? You shall find it not otherwise, my sister, but that either this cursed queen has invented a great lie, or else that she never saw the shape of her husband. And if it is so that she never saw him, then verily she is married to some god, and has a young god in her belly. But if it is a divine babe, and this news comes to the ears of my mother (as God forbid it should) then may I go and hang myself. Wherefore let us go to our parents, and with forged lies let us color the matter.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.17.1#[17] “After they were thus inflamed and had visited their parents, they returned again to the mountain, and by the aid of the wind Zephyrus were carried down into the valley. And after they had strained their eye lids to force themselves to weep, they called to Psyche in this way, ‘You (ignorant of so great evil) think yourself sure and happy, and you sit at home not regarding your peril. But we go about your affairs and are careful lest any harm should happen to you. For we are credibly informed, and we must tell you that there is a great serpent full of deadly poison, with a ravenous gaping throat, that lies with you every night. Remember the Oracle of Apollo, who pronounced that you should be married to a dire and fierce serpent. Many of the inhabitants nearby, and such as hunt about in the country, affirm that they saw him last night returning from pasture and swimming over the river. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.18.1#[18] “‘They undoubtedly say, that he will not pamper you long with delicate foods but, when the time of delivery approaches, he will devour both you and your child. Wherefore advise yourself whether you will agree with us, who are careful of your safety, and so avoid the peril of death and be contented to live with your sisters, or whether you remain with the serpent and in the end be swallowed into the gulf of his body. And if it is the case that your solitary life, your conversation with voices, this servile and dangerous pleasure, and the love of the serpent delight you more, say not but that we have played the parts of natural sisters in warning you.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.18.2#“Then the poor and simple wretch Psyche was moved with the fear of so dreadful words and, being amazed in her mind, clean forgot the admonitions of her husband and her own promises made to him. Throwing herself headlong into extreme misery, with a wan and sallow countenance, she scarcely uttering a word, and at length began speak in this way: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.19.1#[19] “‘O my dearest sisters, I heartily thank you for your great kindness toward me, and I am now verily persuaded that they who have informed you of my situation have informed you of nothing but truth. For I never saw the shape of my husband, neither do I know where he comes from. I only hear his voice at night, such that I have an uncertain husband and one that does not love the light of the day. This causes me to suspect that he is a beast, as you affirm. Moreover, I greatly fear to see him, for he menaces and threatens great evil to me if I should go about to spy and behold his shape. Wherefore, my loving sisters, if you have any wholesome remedy for your sister in danger, give it now presently.’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.19.2#Then they opened the gates of their subtle minds, and put away all privy guile, and egged her forward in her fearful thoughts, persuading her to do as they advised. Whereupon one of them said: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.20.1#[20] “‘Because we little esteem any peril or danger in order to save your life, we intend to show you the best way we can devise. Take a sharp razor and put it under the pillow of your bed; and see that you have ready a privy burning lamp with oil, hid under some part of the hanging of the chamber. And finely dissembling the matter when, according to his custom, he comes to bed and sleeps soundly, arise secretly, and with your bare feet go and take the lamp, with the razor in your right hand. With valiant force cut off the head of the poisonous serpent, and we will aid and assist you. And when by the death of him you shall be made safe, we will marry you to some comely man.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.21.1#[21] “After they had thus inflamed the heart of their sister, fearing lest some danger might happen to them by reason of their evil counsel, they were carried by the wind Zephyrus to the top of the mountain, and so they ran away and took shipping. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.21.2#When Psyche was left alone (except that she seemed not to be alone, being stirred by so many furies), her mind was disturbed like the waves of the sea and, although her will was obstinate and resisted to put in execution the counsel of her sisters, yet she was in doubtful and diverse opinions as to her calamity. Sometimes she would, sometimes she would not, sometimes she is bold, sometimes she is afraid, sometimes she mistrusts, sometimes she is moved, sometime she hates the beast, sometimes she loves her husband. But at length night came, when she prepared for her wicked intent. Soon after her husband came, and when he had kissed and embraced her he fell asleep. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.22.1#[22] “Then Psyche (somewhat feeble in body and mind, yet moved by cruelty of fate) screwed up her courage and brought forth the lamp, and took the razor, and so by her audacity she overcame her timidity. But when she took the lamp and came to the bedside, she saw the most meek and sweetest beast of all beasts, fair Cupid couched fairly, at whose sight the very lamp increased its light for joy, and the razor turned its edge. But when Psyche saw so glorious a body she was greatly afraid and amazed in mind. With a pale countenance and trembling she fell on her knees and thought to hide the razor, yea verily in her own heart, which doubtless she would have done, had it not, through fear of so great a deed, fallen from her hand. And when she saw and beheld the beauty of the divine visage she was restored in her mind. She saw his hairs of gold that yielded out a sweet savor, his neck more white than milk, his purple cheeks, his hair hanging comely behind and before, the brightness of which darkened the light of the lamp. She saw his tender plume feathers, dispersed upon his shoulders like shining flowers and trembling hither and thither, and his other parts of his body so smooth and so soft that it did not repent Venus to bear such a child. At the bed’s feet lay his bow, quiver, and arrows, that are the weapons of so great a god. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.23.1#[23] “When Psyche curiously beheld these things, she, marveling at her husband’s weapons, took one of the arrows out of the quiver, and pricked herself with it, and so she was so grievously wounded that the blood followed, and thereby of her own accord she added love upon love. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.23.2#Then, broiling all the more in the love of Cupid, she embraced him and kissed him and kissed him a thousand times, fearing the measure of his sleep. But alas, while she was in this great joy, whether it was for envy or desire to touch this amiable body, there fell out a drop of burning oil from the lamp upon the right shoulder of the god. O rash and bold lamp, the vile ministry of love, how dare you be so bold as to burn the god of all fire? You who were invented so that all lovers might with more joy pass the nights in pleasure. The god, being burned in this way, and perceiving that promise and faith was broken, fled away without utterance of any word from the eyes and hands of his most unhappy wife. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:5.24.1#[24] “But Psyche happened to catch him as he was rising by the right thigh, and held him fast as he flew above in the air, until such time as constrained by weariness she let go and fell down upon the ground. But Cupid followed her down, and lighted upon the top of a cypress tree, and angrily spoke to her in this manner: ‘O simple Psyche, consider how I, little regarding the command of my mother (who wanted me to make you marry to a man of base and miserable condition), came myself from heaven to love you and wounded my own body with my weapons, to have you for my spouse. And did I seem such a beast to you that you would go about to cut off my head with a razor, I who loved you so well? Did I not always give you a charge? Did not I gently ask you to beware? But those cursed aides and counselors of yours shall be worthily rewarded for their pains. As for you, you shall be sufficiently punished by my absence.’ When he had spoken these words he took his flight into the air. <br><br>

But when he was gone from her sight she threw herself into the nearest river, for such was the great anguish and grief that she felt for the loss of her husband. However, the water would not suffer her to be drowned, but took pity upon her. But in the honor of Cupid, who was accustomed to broil and burn the river, he threw her upon the bank amongst the herbs. <br><br>

After he perceived Psyche in sorrowful case, and not ignorant (I know not by what means) of her miserable condition, he endeavored to pacific her in this way: ‘O fair maid, I am a rustic and rude herdsman. However, by reason of my old age I am expert in many things. For as far as I can learn by conjecture (which wise men call divination), I perceive by your uncertain gait, your pale hue, your sobbing sighs, and your watery eyes, that you are greatly in love. Wherefore hearken to me, and do not go about to slay your self, nor weep at all, but rather adore and worship the great god Cupid, and win him to you by your gentle promise of service.’ <br><br>

After Psyche had gone a little way, she happened unawares to come to a city where the husband of one of her sisters lived. When Psyche understood this, she caused her sister to know of her coming, and so they met together. After great embracing and salutation, the sister of Psyche demanded the cause of her travel thither. ‘Do you not,’ said she, “remember the counsel you gave me, whereby you said that I should kill the beast who under color of my husband lay with me every night? You shall understand that, as soon as I brought forth the lamp to see and behold his shape, I perceived that the son of Venus, Cupid himself, lay with me. Then I, being stricken with great pleasure, and desirous to embrace him, could not thoroughly assuage my delight but, alas, by evil ill chance the oil of the lamp happened to fall on his shoulder and caused him to awake. Seeing me armed with fire and weapons, he said, ‘How dare you be so bold to do so great a mischief? Depart from me and take such things as you brought. For I will have your sister (and named you) to be my wife, and she shall be placed in your felicity.’ And by and by he commanded Zephyrus to carry me away from the bounds of his house. <br><br>

And although there blew a contrary wind, yet being conceiving a vain hope she cried ‘O Cupid take me, a more worthy wife, and you, Zephyrus, bear down your mistress.’ And so she cast herself headlong from the mountain. But she fell into the valley neither alive nor dead, for all the members and parts of her body were torn amongst the rocks, whereby she was made prey to the birds and wild beasts, as she worthily deserved. <br><br>

Then the white gull, which swims on the waves of the water, flew toward the Ocean sea, where he found Venus washing and bathing herself. To her it declared that her son was burned and in danger of death, and moreover that it was a common rumor in the mouth of every person (who spoke evil of all the family of Venus) that her son does nothing but hunt harlots in the mountain, and she herself lasciviously riots in the sea. ‘Because of this they say that everything is no longer gracious, pleasant or gentle, but uncivil, monstrous and horrible. Moreover they say that marriages are not for any amity, or for love of procreation, but full of envy, discord, and debate.’ This the curious gull did clatter in the ears of Venus, criticizing her son. But Venus began to cry and said, ‘What, has my son fallen in love? I pray to you, gentle bird that serves me so faithfully, tell me who she is, and what the name is of her who has troubled my son in this way? Tell me whether she is any of the Nymphs, of the number of the goddesses, of the company of the Muses, or of the mystery of the Graces?’ To her the bird answered, ‘Madam, I know not who she is, but I do know that she is called Psyche.’ Then Venus with indignation cried out, ‘What, is it she?

For being of tender and unripe years, you have with too licentious appetite embraced my most mortal foe, to whom I shall be made a mother, and she a daughter. You presume and think, you trifling boy, you rascal, and without all reverence, that you are most worthy and excellent, and that I am not able by reason of my age to have another son, which if I should have.

Shall I ask aid of my enemy Sobriety, whom I have often offended to engender you? Or shall I seek for counsel of every poor rustic woman? No, no, I would rather die. However, I will not cease my vengeance. To her I must have recourse for help, and to none other (I mean to Sobriety).

Immediately, as she was going away, Juno and Ceres approached, demanding to know the cause of her anger.

And (as I think) you are not ignorant of the rumor of my son Cupid, and of his demeanor, which I am ashamed to declare.’ Then they, understanding the whole matter, tried to mitigate the ire of Venus in this way: ‘What is the cause, madam, or how has your son so offended, that you should so greatly accuse his love and blame him by reason that he is amorous? And why should you seek the death of her whom he fancies? We most humbly entreat you to pardon his fault if he has accorded to the mind of any maiden. Do you not know that he is a young man? Or have you forgotten of what years he is? Does he seem always to you to be a child? You are his mother, and a kind woman. Will you continually search out his dalliance? Will you blame his luxury? Will you bridle his love? And will you reprehend your own art and delights in him? What god or man is he who can endure that you should sow or disperse your seed of love in every place, and still restrain the same behavior within your own house? Certainly you will be the cause of the suppression of the public exposure of young women.’ In this way this goddesses endeavored to pacify her mind, and to excuse Cupid with all their power (although he was absent) for fear of his darts and shafts of love. But Venus would in no way assuage her anger but (thinking that they were rather trifling and taunting her injuries) she departed from them, and took her voyage towards the sea in all haste.<br><br>

She thought that, if he would not be appeased with the sweet flattery of his wife, yet he would take mercy on her for her servile and continual prayers. And (spying a temple on the top of a high hill) she said, ‘Maybe my husband and master is there?’ Wherefore she went there, with great pain and travail, and being moved by hope. After she climbed to the top of the mountain, she came to the temple, and went in. There she saw sheaves of grain lying on a heap, blades withered with garlands, and reeds of barley. Moreover she saw hooks, scythes, sickles, and other instruments for reaping, but everything lay in disorder and, as it were, cast about by the hands of laborers. When Psyche saw this, she gathered up and put everything in order, thinking that she would not despise the temples of any of the gods, but rather get the favor and benevolence of them all. <br><br>

But you have more mind to be here, and care for nothing less than for your safety.’ Then Psyche fell on her knees before her, watering her feet with her tears and wiping the ground with her hair. With great weeping and lamentation she begged pardon, saying, ‘O great and holy goddess, I pray your by your plenteous and liberal right hand, by the joyful ceremonies of your harvest, by the secrets of your sacrifice, by the flying chariots of your dragons, by the tillage of the ground of Sicily (which you discovered), by the marriage of Proserpina, by the diligent search for your daughter, and by the other secrets that are within the temple of Eleusis in the land of Athens, take pity on me, your servant Psyche, and let me hide myself a few days amongst these sheaves of grain, until the ire of so great a goddess is past, or at least until I am refreshed of my great labor and travail.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.3.1#[3] “Then answered Ceres, ‘Verily, Psyche, I am greatly moved by your prayers and tears, and desire with all my heart to aid you. But if I should suffer you to be hidden here, I would increase the displeasure of my cousin, with whom I have made a treaty of peace and an ancient promise of friendship. Wherefore I advise you to depart hence and not to take it badly that I will not allow you to abide and remain here within my temple.’ 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.3.2#Then Psyche, driven away contrary to her hope, was doubly afflicted with sorrow, and so she returned back again. And behold, she perceived a far off in a valley a temple standing within a forest, fair and curiously wrought. Since she intended to pass by no place where better hope directed her, and in order that she could ask pardon of every god, she approached near to the sacred door. There she saw precious riches and vestments engraved with letters of gold hanging upon branches of trees, and the posts of the temple testified the name of the goddess Juno, to whom they were dedicated. Then she kneeled down upon her knees, and embraced the altar with her hands and, wiping her tears, began pray in this way: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.4.1#[4] “‘O dear spouse and sister of the great god Jupiter, you who are adored and worshipped amongst the great temples of Samos, are called upon by women with child, are worshipped at high Carthage because you were brought from heaven by the lion, the rivers of the river Inachus celebrate you. And know that you are the wife of the great god, and the goddess of goddesses. All the eastern part of the world holds you in veneration, all the world calls you Lucina. I pray you to be my advocate in my tribulations, deliver me from the great danger which pursues me, and save me who am weary with so long labors and sorrow. I know that it is you who succors and helps such women as are with child and in danger.’ Then Juno, hearing the prayers of Psyche, appeared to her in all her royalty and said, ‘Truly, Psyche, I would gladly help you, but I am ashamed to do anything contrary to the will of my daughter-in-law Venus, whom I have always loved as my own child. Moreover, I shall incur the danger of the law, entitled, De servo corrupto, whereby I am forbidden to retain any fugitive servant against the will of his master.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.5.1#[5] “Then Psyche, cast off likewise by Juno and being without all hope of the recovery of her husband, reasoned with herself in this way: ‘Now what comfort or remedy is left to my afflictions, when my prayers do not avail the goddesses? What shall I do? Whither shall I go? In what cave or darkness shall I hide myself to avoid the fury of Venus? Why do I not take a good heart, and offer myself with humility to her, whose anger I have wrought? Perhaps he (whom I seek) is in his mothers house.’ Thus being in doubt, poor Psyche prepared herself for her own danger, and devised how she might make her prayer to Venus. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.6.1#[6] “After Venus had grown weary of searching by sea and land for Psyche, she returned toward heaven, and commanded that someone should prepare her chariot. This chariot her husband Vulcan gave to her as a marriage present. It was so finely wrought that neither gold nor silver could be compared to its brightness. Four white doves guided the chariot with great diligence, and when Venus entered it a number of sparrows flew chirping about, making signs of joy, and all other kind of birds sang sweetly, indicating the coming of the great goddess. The clouds gave place, the heavens opened and received her joyfully, the birds that followed did not fear the eagle, hawks, or other ravenous fowl of the air. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.7.1#[7] “Swiftly she went to the royal palace of god Jupiter, and with a proud and bold petition demanded the service of Mercury for certain of her affairs, to which Jupiter consented. Then with much joy she descended from heaven with Mercury, and gave him an earnest charge to put in execution her words, saying: ‘O my Brother, born in Arcadia, you know well that I (who am your sister) have never tried to do anything without your presence. You know also how long I have sought for a girl and cannot find her. Thus there is no other recourse than that you, with your trumpet, should pronounce the reward for whoever captures her. See that you put in execution my command, and declare that whosever retains her wittingly against my will shall not defend himself by any means or excuse.’ When she had spoken this, she gave him a paper, wherein was contained the name of Psyche and other details. This done, she departed away to her lodging. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.8.1#[8] “By and by, Mercury (not delaying the matter) proclaimed throughout all the world that whoever could tell any tidings of a king’s fugitive daughter, the servant of Venus, named Psyche, should bring word to Mercury. As reward for his pains, he would receive seven sweet kisses from Venus. After Mercury had pronounced these things, every man was enflamed with desire to search out Psyche. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.8.2#“This proclamation finally put all doubt from Psyche. She had just came in the sight of the house of Venus, when one of her servants, called Custom, came out. She, perceiving Psyche, cried with a loud voice, saying: ‘O wicked harlot, now at length you shall know that you have a mistress above you. What, will you act as though you did not understand what travail we have taken in searching for you? I am glad that you have come into my hands. You are now in the gulf of hell, and shall abide the pain and punishment for your great arrogance. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.9.1#[9] “And thereupon she took Psyche by the hair, and brought her into the presence of the goddess Venus. When Venus saw her, she began to laugh and, as angry persons are accustomed to do, she shook her head and scratched her right ear saying, ‘O goddess, goddess, you have now come at length to visit your husband, who is in danger of death because of you. Be assured I will handle you like a daughter. Where are my maidens, Sorrow and Sadness?’ To them (when they came) she delivered Psyche to be cruelly tormented. They fulfilled the command of their mistress and, after they had piteously scourged her with rods and whips, they presented her again before Venus. Then she began to laugh again, saying: ‘Behold, she thinks (that by reason of her great belly, which she has gotten by playing the whore) to move me to pity and to make me a grandmother to her child. Am I not happy who, in the flourishing time of all my age, shall be called a grandmother! Shall the son of a vile harlot be accounted the grandson of Venus? However, I am a fool to call him by the name of my son, since, as the marriage was made between unequal persons, in the field without witnesses, and not by the consent of parents, the marriage is illegitimate. Therefore the child (that shall be born) is a bastard. Presuming, of course, that we let you live long enough to deliver the child.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.10.1#[10] “When Venus had spoken these words she leaped upon the face of poor Psyche and (tearing her apparel) took her by the hair and dashed her head upon the ground. Then she took a great quantity of wheat, of barley, poppy seeds, peas, lentils, and beans, and mingled them together in a heap, saying: ‘You evil-favored girl, you seem unable to get the grace of your lover by no other means than by diligent and painful service. Wherefore I will prove what you can do. See that you separate all these grains one from another, disposing them orderly in their quantity, and let it be done before night.’ When she had appointed this task to Psyche, she departed to a great banquet that had been prepared that day. But Psyche did not go about to sort the grain (since it was impossible to accomplish because they grain lay so confusedly scattered), but being astonished at the cruel command of Venus, sat still and said nothing. Then the little ant, taking pity of her great difficulty and labor, and cursing the cruelty of the daughter of Jupiter and of so evil a mother, ran about, hither and thither, and called to all its friends, ‘O quick sons of the ground, the mother of all things, take mercy on this poor maid, spouse to Cupid, who is in great danger of her person. I pray you help her with all diligence.’ Swiftly one came after another, sorting and dividing the grain. After they had put each kind of grain in order, they ran away again in all haste. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.11.1#[11] “When night came, Venus returned home from the banquet well-tippled with wine, smelling of balm, and crowned with garlands of roses. When she had saw what Psyche had done, she said, ‘This is not the labor of your hands, but rather of he who is amorous of you.’ Then she gave her a morsel of brown bread, and went to sleep. In the meantime, Cupid was closed fast in the most secure chamber of the house, partly so that he would not hurt himself with wanton dalliance, and partly so that he would not speak with his love. So these two lovers were divided one from another. When night was passed Venus called Psyche and said, ‘Do you see yonder forest that extends out in length with the river? Out there are great sheep shining like gold who are kept by no manner of person. I command you to go there and bring me home some of the wool of their fleeces.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.12.1#[12] “Psyche arose willingly, not to do her command, but to throw her self headlong into water to end her sorrows. Then a green reed, inspired by divine inspiration, with a gracious tune and melody, said to her, ‘O Psyche, I pray that you not trouble or pollute my water by your death. Yet beware that you not go towards the terrible sheep of this coast until the heat of the sun is past. For when the sun is in his force, they seem most dreadful and furious, with their sharp horns, their stony foreheads and their gaping throats with which they arm themselves to the destruction of mankind. But until they have refreshed themselves in the river, you must hide yourself here by me, under this great plane tree. As soon as their great fury is past, you must go among the thickets and bushes under the wood and gather the locks of their golden fleeces that you find hanging upon the briars.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.13.1#[13] “Thus spoke the gentle and benign reed, showing a way for Psyche to save her life. This she bore well in memory, and with all diligence went and gathered up such locks as she found, and put them in her apron, and carried them home to Venus. However, the danger of this second labor did not please the goddess, nor give her sufficient witness of the good service of Psyche. But with a sour resemblance of laughter she said: ‘Certainly I know that this is not your doing, but I will prove if you are of so stout and so good a courage and of singular prudence as you seem to be.’ Then Venus spoke to Psyche again, saying: ‘Do you see the top of yonder great hill, from where there runs down waters of black and deadly color, which nourish the floods of Styx and Cocytus? I charge you to go thither, and bring me a vessel of that water.’ Thereupon she gave her a bottle of crystal and menaced and threatened her rigorously. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.14.1#[14] “Then poor Psyche went in all haste to the top of the mountain, rather to end her life than to fetch any water. When she came up to the ridge of the hill, she perceived that it was impossible to bring it to pass. For she saw a great rock gushing out most horrible fountains of waters, which ran down and fell by many stops and passages into the valley beneath. On each side she saw great dragons, which were stretching out their long and bloody necks, and never slept, but were appointed to keep the river there. The waters seemed to be saying, ‘Away; away, what will you do? Fly, fly, or else you will be slain.’ Then Psyche (seeing the impossibility of this affair) stood still as though she were transformed into a stone and, although she was present in body, yet was absent in spirit and sense because of the great peril which she saw. She could not even comfort herself with weeping, such was the present danger that she was in. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.15.1#[15] “But the royal bird of great Jupiter, the eagle, remembering his old service which he had done, when by the prick of Cupid he brought up the boy Ganymede to the heavens to be made butler of Jupiter, and minding to show the like service in the person of the wife of Cupid, came from the high-house of the skies, and said to Psyche, ‘O simple woman without any experience, do you think you can get any drop of this dreadful water? No, no, assure yourself you will never be able to come near it, for the gods themselves do greatly fear to see it. What, have you not heard that it is customary among men to swear by the power of the gods, and the gods to swear by the majesty of the river Styx? But give me your bottle.’ Suddenly he took it, and filled it with the water of the river, and taking his flight through those cruel and horrible dragons, brought it to Psyche. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.16.1#[16] “She, being very joyful, presented it to Venus, who would not yet be appeased, but menacing more and more said, ‘What, you seem to me a very witch and enchantress, who brings these things to pass. However you shall do nothing more. Take this box to hell and to Proserpina, and ask her to send me a little of her beauty, as much as will serve me the space of one day. Say that what beauty I had has wasted away since my son fell sick. But return again quickly, for I must dress myself with it and go to the theater of the gods.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.17.1#[17] “Then poor Psyche perceived the end of all fortune, thinking verily that she would never return, and not without cause, since she was compelled to go into the gulf and furies of hell. Wherefore, without any further delay, she went up to an high tower to throw herself down headlong (thinking that it was the next and readiest way to hell). But the tower (as though inspired) spoke to her saying, ‘O poor wretch, why do you go about to slay your self? Why do you rashly yield to your last peril and danger? Don’t you know that if your spirit is once separated from your body, you shall surely go to hell, and never return again?<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.18.1#[18] “‘Wherefore hearken to me. Lacedemon, a city in Greece, is not far from here. Go there and enquire for the hill Taenarus, where you shall find a cave leading to hell, even to the palace of Pluto. But take heed that you do not go with empty hands to that place of darkness. Carry two sops sodden in the flour of barley and honey in your hands, and two pennies in your mouth. And when you have passed a good part of the way, you shall see a lame ass carrying wood, and a lame fellow driving him. He will ask you to give him the sticks that have fallen down. But pass on and do nothing. By and by you shall come to a river of hell where Charon is ferryman. He must first have his fare paid to him before he will carry the souls over the river in his boat. There you may see that avarice reigns even amongst the dead, since neither Charon nor Pluto will do anything for naught. If a poor man wants to pass over and lacks money, he shall be compelled to die in his journey before they will show him any relief. Wherefore deliver to Charon one of the pennies (which you bear for your passage) and let him receive it out of your mouth. And it shall come to pass as you sit in the boat that you shall see an old man swimming on the top of the river, holding up his deadly hands, and asking you to receive him into the boat, but have no regard to his piteous cry. <br><br>

But beware you do not consent to them in any way, for these and like baits and traps Venus will set to make you drop one of your sops. And do not think that the keeping of your sops is a light matter, for if you lose one of them you shall be assured never to return again to this world. Then you shall see a great and marvelous dog, with three heads, barking continually at the souls that enter in, but he can do them no other harm. He lies day and night before the gate of Proserpina, and keeps the house of Pluto with great diligence. If you cast one of your sops to him, you will have access to Proserpina without all danger. She will make you good cheer, and entertain you with delicate food and drink. But sit upon the ground, and desire brown bread, and then declare your message to her. And when you have received such beauty as she gives, on your return appease the rage of the dog with your other sop, and give your other penny to covetous Charon, and come the same way again into the world as you went. But above all things have a regard that you do not look in the box, neither be not too curious about the treasure of the divine beauty.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.20.1#[20] “In this manner tower spoke to Psyche, and told her what she should do. And immediately she took two pennies, two sops, and all things necessary, and went to the mountain Taenarus to go towards hell. After Psyche had passed by the lame ass, paid her penny for passage, neglected the old man in the river, denied to help the woman spinning, and filled the ravenous month of the dog with a sop, she came to the chamber of Proserpina. There Psyche would not sit in any royal seat, nor eat any delicate food, but kneeled at the feet of Proserpina, contented only with coarse bread. She declared her message, and after she had received a mystical secret in a box, she departed, and stopped the mouth of the dog with the other sop, and paid the boatman the other penny. When Psyche returned from hell to the light of the world, she was ravished with great desire, saying, ‘Am not I a fool who, knowing that I carry here divine beauty, will not take a little of it to garnish my face, to please my love?’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.21.1#[21] “And by and by she opened the box where she could perceive no beauty nor any thing else, save only an infernal and deadly sleep, which immediately invaded all her members as soon as the box was uncovered. In this way that she fell down upon the ground, and lay there as a sleeping corpse. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.21.2#“But Cupid, being now healed of his wound and malady, and not able to endure the absence of Psyche, got himself secretly out at a window of the chamber where he was enclosed, and (receiving his wings,) took his flight towards his loving wife. When he had found her, he wiped away the sleep from her face and put it again into the box, and awakened her with the tip of one of his arrows, saying: ‘O wretched one, behold you nearly perished again because of excessive curiosity. Well, go and give your message to my mother and in the meantime, I will provide for all things accordingly.’ Thereupon he took flight into the air, and Psyche brought her present to Venus. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.22.1#[22] “Cupid, being more and more in love with Psyche and fearing the displeasure of his mother, went into the heavens, and arrived before Jupiter to declare his cause. Then Jupiter, after he had again embraced him, began to speak in this manner: ‘O my well-beloved son, although you have not given due reverence and honor to me as you ought to do, but have rather wounded my breast (whereby the law and order of the elements and planets are disposed) with continual assaults of earthly luxury and against all laws, and the lex Julia, and the public good, nevertheless I remember my reasonableness, and the fact that I have nourished you with my own hands. I will do and accomplish all you desire so that you can beware of spiteful and envious persons.

If any of the celestial powers failed to appear, he would be fined ten thousand sesterces. This sentence was such a terror to all the gods that the high theater was filled. And so Jupiter began to speak in this way: ‘O you gods, registered in the books of the Muses, you all know this young man Cupid, whom I have nourished with my own hands, whose raging flames of his first youth I thought best to bridle and restrain. It suffices that he is defamed in every place for his adulterous living. Every opportunity for such behavior ought to be taken away by means of marriage. He has chosen a maiden that fancies him well, and has bereaved her of her virginity. Let him have her still, and possess her according to his own pleasure.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.24.1#[24] “Then he turned to Venus and said, ‘And you, my daughter, take no care, nor fear the dishonor of your progeny and condition, nor have any concern for this mortal marriage. For it seems to me just, lawful, and legitimate by civil law.’ Then Jupiter commanded Mercury to bring up Psyche, the spouse of Cupid, into the palace of heaven. And then he took a pot of immortality, and said, ‘Hold Psyche, and drink, so you will be immortal, and so Cupid may be your everlasting husband.’ By and by the great banquet and marriage feast was sumptuously prepared. Cupid sat down with his dear spouse in his arms, Juno likewise with Jupiter, and all the other gods in order. Ganymede filled the pot of Jupiter, and Bacchus served the rest. Their drink was nectar, the wine of the gods. Vulcan prepared supper, the Hours decked up the house with roses and other sweet smells, the Graces threw about balm, the Muses sang with sweet harmony, Apollo sang pleasantly to the harp, Venus danced finely, Satyrus and Paniscus played on their pipes. Thus Psyche was married to Cupid, and afterward she delivered a child whom we call Pleasure.” [the end of the tale of Cupid and Psyche]<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.25.1#[25] This was the story the old woman declared to the captive maiden. But I, poor ass, not standing far of, was not a little sorry that I lacked pen and ink to write down so worthy a tale. By and by the thieves came home laden with treasure, and many of them who were of strongest courage (leaving behind such as were lame and wounded, to heal and aid themselves) said they would return back again to fetch the rest of their pillage, which they had hidden in a certain cave. And so they snatched up their dinner greedily, and brought us forth into the road and beat us before them with staves. About night (after we had passed over many hills and dales) we came to a great cave, where they loaded us with mighty burdens, and would not suffer us to rest ourselves in any way, but brought us again on the road. They went so fast homeward that, what with their haste and their cruel whipping, I fell down upon a stone by the roadside. They beat me pitifully in lifting me up, and hurt my right thigh and my left hoof. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.26.1#[26] And one of them said, “What shall we do with this lame ill-favoured ass, that is not worth the food he eats?” And other said, “Since the time we found him he has never done any good, and I think he came to our house with evil luck, for we have had great wounds since, and have lost our valiant captains.” And the other said, “As soon as he has brought home his burden, I will surely throw him out upon the mountain to be a pray for wild beasts.” While these gentlemen reasoned together about my death, we happened to come home, for the fear that I was in caused my feet to turn into wings. After we were discharged of our burdens, they went to their fellows who were wounded, and told them of our great slowness on the road. I was not brought into small anguish when I perceived my death prepared before my face. “Why do you stand still Lucius? Why do you not look for your death? Do you not know that the thieves have ordained to slay you? Do you not see these sharp and pointed stones which shall bruise and tear you into pieces, if you happen to be thrown upon them? Your gentle magician has not only given you the shape and travail of an ass, but also a skin as soft and tender as a swallow. Why do you not take courage and run away to save yourself? Are you afraid of the old woman, more than half dead, whom with a blow of your heel you could easily dispatch? But whither shall I fly? What lodging shall I seek? See my ass-like cogitation. Who would not, in passing on the road, take me up?” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.27.1#[27] While I devised these things, I broke the halter with which I was tied and ran away with all my force. However, I could not escape the keen eyes of the old woman, for she ran after me, and with more audacity than became her old age, she caught me by the halter and thought to pull me home. But I, not forgetting the cruel purpose of the thieves, was moved with small pity, for I kicked her with my hind heels to the ground and well nigh slew her. But she (although she was thrown and hurled down) held still the halter, and would not let me go. Then she cried with a loud voice and called for succor, but she little prevailed, because there was no person that heard her, save only the captive gentlewoman. She, hearing the voice of the old woman, came out to see what the matter was and, perceiving her hanging at the halter, took good courage and wrested it out of her hand, and (entreating me with gentle words) got upon my back. Then I began to run, and she gently kicked me forward. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.28.1#[28] I was not displeased by this, for I had as great a desire to escape as she did. So much so that I seemed to run away like a horse. And when the gentlewoman spoke to me, I would answer her with my neighing, and oftentimes (under the pretense of scratching my back) I would sweetly kiss her tender feet. Then she, fetching a sigh from the bottom of her heart, lifted up her eyes to the heavens, saying: “O sovereign gods, deliver me, if it is your pleasure, from these present dangers. And you, cruel Fortune, cease your wrath, let the sorrow suffice that I have already sustained. And you, little ass, who are the occasion of my safety and liberty, if you can once render me safe and sound to my parents, and to him who so greatly desires to have me to his wife, you shall see what thanks I will give. With what honor I will reward you, and how I will use you! First, I will beautifully dress the hairs of your forehead, and then will I finely comb your mane, I will tie up your rugged tail trimly, I will deck you round about with golden trappings, in such sort that you shall glitter like the stars of the sky. I will bring you daily in my apron the kernels of nuts, and will pamper you with delicacies. I will set store by you, as by one that is the preserver of my life. Finally, you shall lack nothing. <br><br>

All the story shall be painted upon the wall of our house, you shall he renowned throughout all the world. And it shall be registered in the books of scholars, that an ass saved the life of a young maiden who was captive amongst thieves. You shall be numbered amongst the ancient miracles. We believe that in a similar way Phrixus saved himself from drowning by riding upon the ram, Arion escaped upon a dolphin, and that Europa was delivered by the bull. If Jupiter transformed himself into a bull, why may it not be that under the shape of this ass is hidden the figure of a man, or some power divine?” While the virgin thus sorrowfully unfolded her desires, we happened to come to a place where three roads met. She took me by the halter and wanted me to turn to the right hand, to her father’s house. But I (knowing that the thieves had gone that way to fetch the rest of their pillage) resisted with my head as much as I could, saying within myself: “What will you do, unhappy maiden? Why would you go so willingly to hell? Why will you run to destruction by means of my feet? Why do you seek your own harm, and mine likewise?” And while we strived together regarding which way we might take, the thieves returned, laden with their spoils, and perceived us far off by the light of the moon. And soon they perceived who we were. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.30.1#[30] One of them said, “Whither do you go so hastily? Are you not afraid of spirits? And you (you harlot), do you not go to see your parents? Come on, we will bear you company.” And therewith they took me by the halter, and drove me back again, beating me cruelly with a great staff (that they had) full of knobs. Then I, returning again to my ready destruction, and remembering the injury to my hoof, began to shake my head and act lame. But he who led me by the halter said, “What, do you stumble? Can you not go? These rotten feet of yours ran well enough before, but now they cannot walk. You could mince it finely even now with the gentlewoman, such that you seemed to surpass the horse Pegasus in swiftness.” In saying these words they beat me again, so that they broke a great staff upon me. And when we were almost home, we saw the old woman hanging upon a bough of a cypress tree. Then one of them cut down the bough on which she hanged, and cast her into the bottom of a great ditch. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.31.1#[31] After this, they bound the maiden and fell greedily to their victuals, which the miserable old woman had prepared for them. Then they began to devise with themselves about our death, and how they might be revenged. Diverse were the opinions of this diverse number. One man said that he thought it best that the maid should be burned alive. Another said she should be thrown out to wild beasts. A third said that she should be hanged upon a gibbet. A fourth said she should be flayed alive. Thus the death of the poor maiden was discussed between these four. But one of the thieves, after every man had declared his judgment, spoke in this manner: “It is not appropriate to the oath of our company to suffer you to act more cruelly than the degree of the offence merits. I would recommend that she should not be hanged nor burned, nor thrown to beasts, nor die any sudden death. But by my counsel I would have her punished according to her desert. You know well what you have determined already for this dull ass, who eats more then he is worth, who feigns lameness, and who was the cause of the flying away of the maid. My mind is that he shall be slain tomorrow, and when all the guts and entrails of his body are taken out, let the maid be sewn into his belly, then let us lay them upon a great stone in the broiling heat of the sun. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:6.32.1#[32] “Thus they shall both sustain all the punishments which you have ordained. First the ass shall be slain as you have determined, and she shall have her members torn and gnawed by wild beasts. When she is bitten and rent by worms, she shall endure the pain of the fire, when the broiling heat of the sun shall scorch and parch the belly of the ass. She shall abide the gallows when the dogs and vultures have the guts of her body hanging in their ravenous mouths. I pray you, number all the torments which she shall suffer. First she shall dwell within the paunch of an ass. Second her nostrils shall receive the foul stink of the beast. Third she shall die of hunger. Last of all, she shall find no means to rid her self from her pains, for her hand shall be sewn up within the skin of the ass.” This being said, all the thieves consented. When I (poor ass) heard and understood all their designs, I did nothing else but lament and bewail my dead carcass, which should be handled in such sort the next morning. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.1.1#[1] As soon as night was past and the clear chariot of the sun had spread his bright beams on every coast, one of the company of the thieves came (for so his and their greeting together did declare) who, at the first entry into the cave (after he had rested himself, and was able to speak), told these tidings to his companions in this sort. “Sirs, regarding the house of Milo of Hypata, which we forcibly entered and ransacked yesterday, we may put away all fear and doubt. For after you, by force of arms, had spoiled and taken away all things in the house, and returned hither into our cave, I (thrusting my self amongst the press of the people, and showing myself as though I was sad and sorrowful for the mischance) consulted with them as to the investigation of the matter, and as to what means were being wrought for the apprehension of the thieves, so that I might learn and see all that was going to be done about you (as you willed me). The whole deed was at length, by manifest and evident proofs, and also by the common opinion and judgment of the people, attributed to one Lucius, charged as manifest author of this common robbery. He, a few days before, by false and forged letters and colored honesty, fell so far in favor with this Milo that he was entertained in his house and received as a chief of his familiar friends. This Lucius, after that he had sojourned there a good space and won the heart of Milo’s maid by feigned love, thoroughly learned the ways and doors of all the house, and curiously viewed the coffers and chests, where the whole substance of Milo was stored. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.2.1#[2] “Neither was there small cause given to judge him guilty, since the very same night when this robbery occurred he fled away and could not be found anywhere. So that he might cleanly escape and better prevent such hue and cry made after him, he took his white horse and galloped away. After this, his servant was found in the house who (accused as accessory to the felony and escape of his master) was committed to the common jail. And the next day he was cruelly scourged and tormented till he was nearly dead, so that he would confess the matter. But when they could wrest or learn nothing from him, they sent many persons afterwards to Lucius’ country to inquire about him, and so to take him prisoner.” As he declared these things, I greatly lamented with myself, to think of my former, having being changed into a miserable ass. Then I had no small occasion to remember how the ancient writers used to affirm that fortune was stark blind and without eyes, because she always bestows her riches upon evil persons, and fools, and chooses or favors no mortal person by judgment, but is always conversant with those she should most shun (especially if she could see). And what is worse, she shows such evil or contrary opinions in men, so that the wicked glory in the name of good, and the good and innocent are detracted and slandered as evil. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.3.1#[3] Furthermore I, who by fortune’s great cruelty was turned into a four-footed ass in most vile and abject manner, and whose condition seemed worthily to be lamented and pitied by the most hard and stony hearts, was accused of theft and robbing of my dear host Milo. This villainy might rather be called parricide then theft, yet I could not defend my own cause or deny the deed in any way because I could not speak. However, at least my conscience seemed to accuse me by reason of silence, and again being forced by impatience I endeavored to speak, and would have said, “I never did that deed,” and indeed I said the first word “Never” once or twice somewhat handsomely, but the rest I could not pronounce. But still, remaining in one voice, I cried, “Never, never, never.” However, I shaped my hanging lips as round as I could to as to say the rest. But why should I further complain of the cruelty of my fortune, since I was not totally unhappy, because my servant and my horse were likewise accused with me of the robbery. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.4.1#[4] While I pondered all these things, I remembered with great distress the death sentence that the thieves had devised for me and the maiden. And still, as I looked down at my belly, I thought of my poor gentlewoman who would be closed within me. The thief who a little before had brought the false charges against me drew out of the skirt of his coat a thousand gold pieces which he had rifled from those he met, and brought it into the common treasury. Then he carefully enquired how the rest of his companions were. It was declared to him that the most valiant had been murdered and slain in various ways. Whereupon he persuaded them to remit all their affairs a little while, and to seek others to fill their places, so that by the exercise of new lads, the terror of their martial band might be increased to the old number. He assured them that those who were unwilling might be compelled by menaces and threats, and those who were willing might be encouraged with rewards. Further, he said that there were some, who (seeing the profit that they had) would forsake their base and servile condition, and would rather be contented to live like tyrants amongst them. Moreover, he declared that for his part he had spoken with a certain tall man, a valiant companion, but of young age, stout in body, and courageous at fighting. He said that he had fully persuaded this young man to exercise his idle hands, which had become dull with slothfulness, to his greater profit, and (while he might) in order to receive the bliss of better fortune. He was urged not to hold out his sturdy arm to beg for a penny, but rather to take as much gold and silver as he could. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.5.1#[5] Then everyone consented that he that seemed worthy to be their companion, and that they would search for others to make up the rest of the number. Whereupon the thief went out, and by and by (returning again) brought in a tall young man (as he promised) to whom none of the rest could be compared. For he was taller than them by the head and of greater size in body. His beard was just beginning to grow, but he was poorly appareled, such that you might see all his belly naked. As soon as he entered in he said, “God speed to you soldiers of Mars and my faithful companions, I pray you make me one of your band, and I will ensure you that you shall have a man of singular courage and lively audacity. For I would rather receive a whipping upon my back, than money or gold in my hands. And, as for death (which every man fears), I care nothing at all. Yet do not think that I am an abject or a beggar, nor judge my virtue and prowess by my ragged clothes. I have been a captain of a great company, and subdued all the country of Macedonia. I am the renowned thief Haemus the Thracian, whose name all countries and nations greatly fear. I am the son of Theron the noble thief, nourished with human blood, entertained amongst the stoutest men, Finally I am inheritor and follower of all my father’s virtues. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.6.1#[6] “Yet I lost in a short time all my company and all my riches in one assault that I made upon a officer of the emperor. For fortune was clean against me. Hearken and I will tell you the whole matter. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.6.2#There was a certain man in the court of the emperor who had many offices, and was in great favor, who at last, on account of the envy of various persons, was banished and compelled to forsake the court. His wife Plotina, a woman of rare faith and singular modesty, having borne ten children to her husband, despised all worldly pomp and delicacy and determined to follow her husband, and to share his perils and danger. Wherefore she cut off her hair, disguised herself like a man, and took with her all her treasure, passing through the hands of the soldiers and naked swords without any fear. Whereby she endured many miseries, and was partaker of much affliction, in order to save the life of her husband. Such was the love which she bore for him. And when they had escaped many perilous dangers, by land as well as by sea, they went together towards Zacynthus, to continue there according to what fortune had appointed. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.7.1#[7] “But when they arrived on the sea coast of Actium (where we in our return from Macedon were roving about), when night came, they returned to a house not far distant from their ship, where they lain all night. Then we entered and took away all their substance, but verily we were in great danger. For the good matron, perceiving us swiftly by the noise of the gate, went into the chamber and called up every man by his name, and likewise the neighbors who were living round about. Thusly, because of the fear that everyone was in, we hardly escaped. But this most holy woman, faithful and true to her husband (as the truth must be declared), returned to Caesar, asking for his aid and authority and demanding vengeance for the injury done to her husband. He granted all her desire. Then my company went to ruin, in that every man was slain. So great was the authority and word of the emperor. However, when all my band was lost and taken by search of the emperor’s army, I alone stole away and saved myself from the violence of the soldiers. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.8.1#[8] “For I clothed myself in a woman’s attire, and mounted upon an ass that was carrying barley sheaves, and passing through the middle of them all I escaped, because everyone deemed that I was a woman because I lacked a beard. However, I did not leave off for all this, nor did I degenerate from the glory of my father or from my own virtue. But freshly coming from the bloody skirmish and disguised like a woman, I invaded towns and castles alone to get some spoils.” And thereupon he pulled out two thousand gold pieces which he had under his coat, saying, “Hold here the dowry which I present to you, hold also my person, which you shall always find trusty and faithful, if you willingly receive me. And I will ensure you that in so doing, within a short space, I will turn this stony house of yours into gold.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.9.1#[9] Then by and by every one consented to make him their captain, and so they gave him better garments, and threw away his old ones. When they had changed his attire, he embraced them one after another, then they sat him in the place of honor at the table, and drank to him in token of good luck. After supper they began to talk and declare to him the attempted escape of the gentlewoman, and how I bore her upon my back, and what death was ordained for us two. Then he asked to see her, whereupon the gentlewoman was brought forth, bound fast. As soon as he beheld her, he turned away wringing his nose and blamed them, saying, “I am not so much a beast or so rash a fellow to drive you from your purpose, but my conscience will not suffer me to conceal anything that pertains to your profit, since I am careful for you. However, if my counsel displeases you, you may at your liberty proceed in your enterprise. I do not doubt that all thieves, and those who have a good judgment, will prefer their own advantage and gain above all things in the world, even above vengeance, which purchases damage to various persons. Therefore if you put this virgin in the ass’ belly, you shall but execute your indignation against her, without any manner of profit. But I would advise you to carry the virgin to some town and sell her. Since she is such a brave girl, she may be sold for a great quantity of money. I myself know certain bawdy merchants, amongst whom surely one will give us sums of gold for her. This is my opinion regarding this affair. But decide what you intend to do, for you may overrule me in this case.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.10.1#[10] In this manner the good thief pleaded and defended our cause, being a good patron to the silly virgin, and to me, poor ass. They deliberated on the matter for a long time, which made my heart (God knows) and spirit greatly afraid. However, in the end they consented to his opinion, and by and by the maiden was unloosed of her bonds. She, seeing the young man and hearing the name of brothels and bawdy merchants, began to wax joyful, and smiled to herself. Then I began to think evil of the generation of women when as I saw the maiden (who was appointed to be married to a young gentleman and who so greatly desired him) was now delighted with the talk of a wicked brothel house, and other things dishonest. In this way the consent and manners of women depended in the judgment of an ass. Then the young man spoke again, saying, “Masters, why do we not go about making our prayers to Mars regarding the selling of the maiden, and to seek for other companions? But as far as I see, there is no beast to make sacrifice with, nor wine sufficient for us to drink. Let me have ten men, and we will go to the next castle to get food and other things necessary.” So he and ten men went their way. In the meantime the rest made a great fire and an altar of green turf in the honor of Mars. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.11.1#[11] By and by after they came back again, bringing with them bottles of wine and a great number of beasts. Among the beasts there was a big ram goat, fat, old, and hairy, which they killed and offered to Mars. Then supper was prepared sumptuously, and the new companion said to the others, “You ought to count me not only your captain in robbery and fight, but also in pleasures and jollity.” Whereupon with pleasant cheer he prepared food and, trimming up the house, he set all things in order, and brought the pottage and dainty dishes to the table. But above all he plied them well with great pots and jugs of wine. Sometimes (seeming to fetch some more) he would go to the maiden and give her pieces of meat, which he had secretly taken, and give her drink, which she willingly took in good part. Moreover, he kissed her twice or thrice for which she was well pleased. But I (unhappy at this) thought to myself: “O wretched maid, you have forgotten your marriage, and esteem this stranger and bloody thief above your husband, whom your parents ordained for thee. Now I perceive well that you have no remorse in your conscience, but rather delight to tarry and play the harlot hear amongst so many swords. What? Do you not know how the other thieves, if they knew your demeanor, would put you to death as they had once decided, and so work my destruction likewise? Well now, I perceive you take pleasure in the damage and hurt of others.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.12.1#[12] While I angrily devised all these things, I perceived that, by certain signs and tokens (not ignorant to so wise an ass), he was not the notable thief Haemus, but rather Tlepolemus her husband. After much conversation he began to speak more frankly, not fearing at all my presence, and said, “Be of good cheer my sweet girl Charite, for you shall soon have all your enemies as captives. Then he filled wine for the thieves more and more, and never ceased till they were all overcome with abundance of food and drink. He, on the other hand, abstained and bridled his own appetite. And truly I did greatly suspect that he had mingled in their cups some powerful poison, for quickly they all fell down asleep on the ground one after an other, and lay as though they were dead. When the thieves were all asleep by their great and immoderate drinking, the young man Tlepolemus took the maiden and set her upon my back, and went homeward. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.13.1#[13] When we had come home, all the people of the city, especially her parents, friends, and family, came running forth joyfully, and the children and maidens of the town gathered together to see this virgin in great triumph sitting upon an ass. Then I (willing to show as much joy as I could in present occasion) pricked up my long ears, rattled my nostrils, and cried stoutly. Nay rather I made the town echo with my shrilling sound. When we came to her father’s house, she was received in a chamber honorably. As for me, Tlepolemus (accompanied with a great number of citizens) presently drove me back again with other horses to the cave of the thieves, where we found them all asleep lying on the ground as we left them. The citizens first brought out all the gold and silver and other treasure of the house, and loaded us with it. When they had done this, they threw many of the thieves down into the bottom of deep ditches, and the rest they slew with their swords. After this we returned home glad and merry because of so great vengeance upon them, and the riches which we carried was committed to the public treasury. This done, the maid was married to Tlepolemus, according to the law, whom by so much travail he had valiantly recovered. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.14.1#[14] Then my good mistress looked about for me and, asking for me, commanded on the very same day of her marriage that my manger should be filled with barley, and that I should have hay and oats abundantly, and she would call me her little camel. But how greatly did I curse Fotis, in that she transformed me into an ass and not into a dog, because I saw the dogs had filled their paunches with the remains and bones of so worthy a supper. The next day this new wedded woman (my mistress) greatly commended me before her parents and husband for the kindness I had shown her, and never left off until they promised to reward me with great honors. Then they called together all their friends, and thus it was concluded: one said that I should be closed in a stable and never work, but continually be fed and fatted with fine and chosen barley and beans and good litter. However another prevailed who, wishing my liberty, persuaded them that it was better for me to run in the fields amongst the lascivious horses and mares, whereby I might engender some mules for my mistress. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.15.1#[15] Then the man who was in charge of keeping the horses was called for, and I was delivered to him with great care. I was very happy and joyous because I thought that I would carry no more packs or burdens. Moreover I thought that, when I should thus be at liberty, in the spring time of the year, when the meadows and fields were green, I should find some roses in some place. Thus I was fully persuaded that, if my master and mistress rendered me so many thanks and honors when I was an ass, they would much more reward me when I would be turned into a man. But when he (to whom the charge of me was so straightly committed) had brought me a good way distant from the city, I perceived that no delicate food or liberty was in store for me, but by and by his covetous wife and most cursed mistress made me a mill ass, and (beating me with a cudgel full of knots) would wring bread for herself and her husband out of my skin. Yet was she not contented to weary me and make me a drudge with carriage and grinding of her own corn, but I was hired out to her neighbors to bear their sacks likewise. However she would not give me such food as I needed, nor sufficient to sustain my life. The barley that I ground for my own dinner she would sell to the villagers nearby. And after I had labored all day, she would set before me at night a little filthy bran, not clean but full of stones. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.16.1#[16] While I was afflicted with this calamity, fortune worked for me other torments. One day I was let loose into the fields to pasture by the command of my master. How I leapt for joy, how I neighed to see my self in such liberty, especially since I beheld so many mares who I thought would be my wives and concubines. I discerned and chose the fairest before I came near them. But my joyful hope turned into utter destruction, for swiftly all the male horses, who were well fed and made strong by ease of pasture and thereby much more powerful then a poor ass, became jealous of me, and (having no regard to the law and order of Jupiter) ran fiercely and terribly at me. One lifted up his forefeet and kicked me spitefully, another turned himself, and with his hind heels struck me cruelly, the third, threatening with a malicious neighing, dressed his ears and, showing his sharp and white teeth, bit me on every side. In similar sort have I read in Histories how the king of Thrace would throw his miserable guests to be torn in pieces and devoured by his wild horses. So ungenerous was that tyrant of his provender, that he nourished them with the bodies of men. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.17.1#[17] After I was thus handled by horses, I was brought home again to the mill, but behold, fortune (insatiable of my torments) had devised a new pain for me. I was appointed to bring home wood every day from a high hill, and who should drive me thither and home again but a boy that was the worst tormentor in all the world. He was not content with the great travail that I took in climbing up the hill, nor was he pleased when he saw my hoof torn and worn away by sharp stones, but he beat me cruelly with a great staff, so much so that the marrow of my bones ached for woe. He would strike me continually on the right hip in the same place, whereby he tore my skin and made my wide sore into a great hole or trench, or rather a window to look out at. Although it ran down blood, he would not cease beating me in that place. Moreover he loaded me with such great burdens of wood that you would think they had been rather prepared for elephants rather than for me. And when he perceived that my wood hung more on one side than the other, instead of taking away the heavy sides, and so ease me, or else lift them up to make them equal with the other, he laid great stones upon the weaker side to remedy the matter. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.18.1#[18] Yet he could not be contented with my great misery and immoderate burdens of wood, but when he came to any river (as there were many by the way) he, to save his feet from water, would leap upon my loins likewise, which was no small load. And if by adversity I fell down in any dirty or muddy place, when he could have pulled me out either with ropes, or lifted me up by the tail, he would never help me but he would beat me from head to toe with a mighty staff till there was no hair left on all my body, not even on my ears. Thus I was compelled by force of blows to stand up. The same wicked boy invented another torment for me: he gathered a great many sharp thorns, as sharp as needles, and bound them together like a bundle, and tied them to my tail to prick me. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.19.1#[19] Then was I afflicted on every side, for if I endeavored to run away, the thorns would prick me. If I had stood still, the boy would beat me, and yet the boy beat me to make me run, whereby I perceived that the wretch devised nothing else except to kill me by some means, and he would swear and threaten to do me worse harm. And because he might have some occasion to execute his malicious intent, one day (after I had suffered too much at his hands) I lifted up my heels and struck him stoutly. Then he devised this vengeance against me: after that he had well loaded me with shrubs and rubble, and trussed it round upon my back, he brought me out into the road. Then he stole a burning coal out of a man’s house in the next village, and put it into the middle of the rubble. The rubble and shrubs were very dry, and caught fire and burned me on every side. I could see no remedy how I might save myself, and in any a case it was not best for me to stand still <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.20.1#[20] But fortune was favorable towards me, perhaps to reserve me for more dangers, for I saw a great hole full of rainwater that had fallen the day before. I ran there hastily and plunged myself in the water so that I quenched the fire, and was saved from that present peril. But the vile boy, to excuse himself, declared to all the neighbors and shepherds about that I willingly tumbled in the fire as I passed through the village. Then he laughed at me saying: “How long shall we nourish and keep this fiery ass in vain?” A few days after, the boy invented another mischief. For when he had sold all the wood which I bore to certain men dwelling in a village nearby, he led me homeward unloaded. And then he cried that he was not able to manage me, and that he would not drive me any longer to the hill for wood, saying:<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.21.1#[21] “Do you not see this slow and dull ass who, besides all the mischief that he has wrought already, invents daily more and more. For if he espies any woman passing by the way, whether she is old or married or if she is a young child, he will throw his burden from his back, and run fiercely upon them. And after he has thrown them down, he will stride over them to commit his buggery and beastly pleasure. Moreover he will pretend to would kiss them, but he will bite their faces cruelly. This may cause us great displeasure, or rather to be imputed to us as a crime. And even now, when he saw an honest maiden passing by the highway, he by and by threw down his wood and ran after her. And when he had thrown her down upon the ground, he would have ravished her before the face of all the world, had it not been that, by reason of her crying out, she was succored and pulled from his heels, and so saved. And if it had so come to pass that this fearful maid had been slain by him, what danger would we have been in?” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.22.1#[22] By these and like lies, he provoked the shepherds earnestly against me. It grieved me (God knows) sorely that I could say nothing. Then one of the shepherds said: “Why do we not make sacrifice of this common adulterous ass? My son, let us kill him and throw his guts to the dogs, and reserve his flesh for the laborers’ supper. Then let us cast dust upon his skin, and carry it home to our master, and say that the wolves have devoured him.” The boy who was my evil accuser made no delay, but prepared himself to execute the sentence of the shepherd, rejoicing at my present danger. But O how greatly did I then repent that the blow which I gave him with my heel had not killed him. He drew out his sword and made it sharp upon the whetstone to slay me, but another of the shepherds began to say:<br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.23.1#[23] “Verily it is a great offence to kill so fair an ass, and so (even though he is accused of luxury and lascivious wantonness) to lack his necessary labor and service. But if you cut off his testicles, he might not only be deprived of his courage but also become gentle, and we should be delivered from all fear and danger. Moreover he would be thereby fatter and better in flesh. For I know myself that many asses, just as is the case with very spirited horses, by reason of their wantonness become most mad and terrible, but (when they were gelded and cut) they have become gentle and tame, and tractable to all use. Wherefore I would counsel you to geld him. And if you consent to this, I will by and by, when I go to the next market, fetch my irons and tools for the purpose. And I ensure you that, after that I have gelded and cut off his testicles, I will deliver him to you as tame as a lamb.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.24.1#[24] When I perceived that I had been saved from death and reserved to be gelded, I was greatly sorry, and I thought that all the hind part of my body and my testicles ached for woe. And so I sought to kill myself by some means so that, if I should die, I would die with intact members. While I devised how I might end my life, the vile boy on the next morning led me to the same hill again, and tied me to a bough of a great oak. In the meantime he took his hatchet and cut wood to load me with. But behold there crept out of a cave nearby a marvelous great bear, holding out his mighty head. When I saw it, I was suddenly struck with fear, and (throwing all the strength of my body into my hind heels) lifted up my strained head and broke the halter with which I was tied. Then there was no need to bid me to run away, for I scoured not only on foot, but tumbled over the stones and rocks with my body till I came to the open fields so I could escape from the terrible bear, but especially from the boy who was worse than the bear. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.25.1#[25] Then a certain stranger that passed by the way (discerning me alone as a stray ass) took me up and rode upon my back, beating me with a staff (which he bore in his hand) through a wide and unknown lane. I was not displeased at this, but willingly went forward to avoid the cruel pain of gelding, which the shepherds had ordained for me. As for the beating, I was not moved since I was accustomed to be beaten so every day. But evil fortune would not suffer me to continue in so good a condition for long: For the shepherds, looking about for a cow that they had lost (after they had sought it in various places) happened to come upon us unawares. When they saw and knew me, they would have taken me by the halter. But the man who rode upon my back resisted them saying, “O Lord masters, what do you intend to do? Will you rob me?” Then the shepherds said, “What? Do you think that we handle you otherwise than you deserve, you who have stolen away our ass? Why do you not tell us where your have hidden the boy whom you have slain?” And thereupon they pulled him down to the ground and beat him with their fists and kicked him with their feet. Then he answered them saying that he saw no boy, but only found the ass loose and straying abroad, which he took up so as to have some reward for the finding of him and to restore him again to his master. “And I would to God,” said he, “that this ass (whom I wish I had never seen) could speak as a man to give witness to my innocence. Then would you be ashamed of the injury that you have done to me.” Thus (reasoning for himself) he did not prevail, for they tied the halter about my neck, and pulled me quite away, and led me back again through the woods of the hill to the place where the boy accustomed to resort. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.26.1#[26] They could find him in nowhere at first, but at length they found his body rent and torn in pieces, and his members dispersed in sundry places, This deed I well knew had been done by the cruel bear. And verily I would have told them so if I could have spoken, but (which I could only do) I greatly rejoiced at his death, although it came too late. Then they gathered together the pieces of his body and buried them. By and by they laid the fault to my new master who had taken me up by the road, and (bringing him home, bound fast, to their houses) purposed on the next day to accuse him of murder, and to lead him before the justices to have judgment of death. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.26.2#In the meantime, while the parents of the boy lamented and wept for the death of their son, the shepherd (according to his promise) came with his instruments and tools to geld me. Then one of them said, “Bah! We little esteem the mischief he did yesterday, but now we are contented that tomorrow not only his testicles shall be cut off, but also his head.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.27.1#[27] So was it brought to pass that my death was delayed till the next morning. O but what thanks did I give to that good boy, who (being so slain) was the cause of my pardon for one short day. However, I had no time then to rest myself, for the mother of the boy, weeping and lamenting for his death, attired in mourning vesture, tore her hair and beat her breast, and came presently into the stable, saying, “Is it right that this careless beast should do nothing all day but hold his head in the manger, filling his guts with food, without compassion for my great misery, or remembrance of the pitiful death of his slain master? And, despising my age and infirmity, he thinks that I am unable to revenge his mischief. Moreover he would persuade me that he was not culpable. Indeed, it is a convenient thing to look and plead for safety when the conscience confesses the offence, as thieves and malefactors are accustomed to do. But, O good Lord, you cursed beast, if you could utter the contents of you mind, whom (though it were the truest fool in all the world) could you persuade that this murder was not your fault? Did it not lay in your power either to keep off the thieves with your heels, or else to bite and tear them with your teeth? Could you not (who so often in his life time struck and kicked him) defend him now at the point of death in the same way? Yet at least, your should have taken him upon your back, and so brought him from the cruel hands of the thieves. But instead you ran away alone, forsaking your good master, your pastor and conductor. Don’t you know that those who deny their wholesome help and aid to those who lie in danger of death ought to be punished? This is because they have offended against good manners and natural law! But I promise you, you shall not long rejoice at my grief, you shall feel the pain of your homicide and offence. I will see what I can do.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:7.28.1#[28] And thereupon she took off her apron, and bound all my feet together so that I might not help myself. Then she took a great bar, which accustomed to bar the stable door, and never ceased beating me till she was so weary that the bar fell out of her hands. Whereupon she (complaining of that her arms became faint too soon) ran to her fire and brought a firebrand and thrust it under my tail, burning me continually, till such time as I (having but one remedy) arrayed her face and eyes with my dirty dung. Whereby (what with the stink thereof, and what with the filth that fell in her eyes) she was nearly blinded. So I forced the woman to leave off, otherwise I might have died as Meleager did by the stick which his mad mother Althea cast into the fire. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.1.1#[1] About midnight came a young man who seemed to be one of the family of the good woman Charite (who once endured so much misery and calamity with me amongst the thieves). After he had taken a stool and sat down before the fire in the company of the servants, he began to declare many terrible things that had happened to the house of Charite, saying: “O you house-keepers, shepherds and cowherds, understand that we have lost our good mistress Charite miserably and by evil adventure. And so that you may learn and know the whole matter, I intend to tell you the circumstances point by point, so that those who are more learned than I (to whom fortune has give more copious style) may write it out in paper in form of a History. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.1.2#There was a young gentleman dwelling in the next city, born of good parentage, valiant in prowess, and rich in substance, but very much given and addicted to whoring and continual reveling. He fell in company with thieves and was eager for the shedding of human blood. His name was Thrasyllus. His character was thus according to the report of every man. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.2.1#[2] “He demanded Charite in marriage and, although he was a man more comely then the rest of those who wooed her, and also had riches abundantly, yet because he had a bad reputation and was a man of wicked manners and conversation, he was repulsed and put off by Charite. And so she married Tlepolemus. However this young man secretly loved her, even though he was offended somewhat by her refusal, and he busily searched some means to work his damnable intent. And (having found occasion and opportunity to accomplish the purpose which he had long time concealed) he brought it to pass that on the same day Charite was saved by the subtle means and valiant audacity of her husband from the captivity of the thieves, he mingled himself among the assembly, and pretended that he was glad of the new marriage and the return of the maiden. Whereby (since he came of such noble parents) he was received and entertained in the house as one of their chief and principal friends. However, under the guise of a faithful well-wisher, he concealed his mischievous mind and intent. Subsequently by much familiarity and by frequent conversation and banqueting together, he fell more and more in favor. This is what happens to lovers who first little delight themselves in love, but by continual acquaintance they kiss and embrace each other. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.3.1#[3] “Thrasyllus perceived that it was a hard matter to disclose his thoughts secretly to Charite, and so was wholly barred from the accomplishment of his luxurious desire. On the other hand, he perceived that the love between her and her husband was so strong that the bond between them might in no way be severed. On this ground too he understood that it was impossible to ravish her. Although he knew all this, he was still provoked forward by vehement lust. At length the thing which seemed so hard and difficult, through hope of his fortified love, now appeared easy and simple. But mark, I pray you, diligently what end the furious force of his inordinate desire came to. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.4.1#[4] “One day Tlepolemus went hunting with Thrasyllus for goats (goats, because his wife Charites desired him earnestly to meddle with no other beasts which were more fierce and wild by nature). When during the chase they came to a great thicket surrounded with briars and thorns, they sent their dogs around it and beset every place with nets. By and by the sign was given to let the dogs loose. The dogs rushed in with such a cry that all the forest echoed with the noise. But behold, there leaped out no goat, nor deer, nor gentle hind, but a horrible and dangerous wild boar, hard and thick-skinned, bristling terribly with thorns, foaming at the mouth, grinding his teeth, and looking threateningly with fiery eyes. He tore and rent with his tusks the dogs that first set upon him, and then he ran right through the nets, and escaped away. When we saw the fury of this beast, we were greatly stricken with fear because we were not accustomed to chase such dreadful boars, and further because we were unarmed. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.5.1#[5] “And so we hid ourselves under bushes and trees. Then Thrasyllus, having found opportunity to work his treason, said to Tlepolemus: ‘What, do we stand here amazed? Why do we show ourselves like cowards? Why do we lose so worthy a prey because of our feminine hearts? Let us mount upon our horses and pursue him swiftly. Take a hunting staff, and I will take a chasing spear.’ By and by they leaped upon their horses and followed the beast. But the boar, returning against them with furious force, looked to see whom he might first assail with his tusks. Tlepolemus struck the beast first on the back with his hunting staff. Thrasyllus, pretending to aid and assist him, came behind, and cut off the hind legs of Tlepolemus’ horse so that he fell to the ground with his master. And suddenly the boar came upon Tlepolemus and furiously tore and rent him with his tusks. However, Thrasyllus was not content to see him thus wounded, but when he asked for help, he thrust Tlepolemus through the right thigh with his spear, because he thought the wound of the spear would be taken for a wound of the boar’s teeth. Then he killed the beast likewise. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.6.1#[6] “And when Tlepolemus was thus miserably slain, everyone of us came out of our holes and went towards our slain master. But although Thrasyllus was joyful for the death of Tlepolemus, whom he did greatly hate, yet he cloaked the matter with a sorrowful countenance and feigned a sad face. He often embraced the body which himself slew, he played all the parts of a mourning person, except no tears fell from his eyes. Thus he resembled us in each point, who verily and not without occasion had cause to lament for our master, and we laid all the blame for this homicide on the boar. 
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.6.2#Soon afterward the sorrowful news of the death of Tlepolemus came to the ears of all the family, but especially to Charite who, after she had heard such pitiful tidings, ran up and down the streets crying and howling lamentably like a madwoman. All the citizens gathered together, and whomever they met bore them company in running towards the scene. When they came to the slain body of Tlepolemus, Charite threw herself upon him weeping and lamenting grievously for his death, so that she would have presently ended her life upon the corpse of her slain husband, whom she so entirely loved, had it not been for her parents and friends who comforted her and pulled her away. The body was taken up and, in funeral pomp, was brought to the city and buried. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.7.1#[7] “In the meantime, Thrasyllus feigned much sorrow for the death of Tlepolemus, but in his heart he was well pleased and joyful. And to counterfeit the matter, he would come to Charite and say: ‘O what a loss I have had of my friend, my fellow, my companion Tlepolemus! O Charite, comfort your self, pacify your grief, refrain your weeping, do not beat your breasts.’ And with such and like words he endeavored to suppress her great sorrow. But he said these things not for any other reason than to win the heart of the woman, and to nourish his odious love with filthy delight. However Charite, after the burial of her husband, sought the means to follow him and (not enduring the sorrows she felt) went secretly into a chamber and intended to finish her life there with grief and tribulation. But Thrasyllus was very insistent and at length brought it to pass that, at the intercession of the parents and friends of Charite, she somewhat refreshed her fallen members with food and bath. However, she did it more at the command of her parents than for any thing else. For she could in no way be merry, or receive any comfort, but tormented herself day and night before the image of her husband which she made like unto Bacchus, and rendered to him divine honors and services. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.8.1#[8] “In the meantime Thrasyllus was not able to restrain himself any longer. He could not wait for Charite to assuage her grief, nor for her troubled mind to pacify her fury. Even in the middle of all her grief, while she tore her hair and rent her garments, he demanded her in marriage. Thusly, without shame, he revealed the secrets and unspeakable deceits of his heart. But Charite detested and abhorred his demand, and as though she had been stricken with some clap of thunder in some storm, or with the lightning of Jupiter, she presently fell down to the ground stunned. However, when her spirits were revived and she returned to herself, she, perceiving that Thrasyllus was so insistent, demanded respite to deliberate and to take advice on the matter. In the meantime, the shade of Tlepolemus, who had been slain so miserably, appeared to Charite saying, ‘O my sweet wife (a thing which no other person can say but I), I pray you by the love between us, if there is any memory of me in your heart, or remembrance of my pitiful death, marry anyone you like except the traitor Thrasyllus, and have no contact with him. Do not eat with him or lie with him. Avoid the bloody hand of my enemy, do not couple yourself with a parricide. For these wounds (the blood that your tears washed away) were not the wounds of the teeth of the boar. The spear of Thrasyllus took me from you.’ Thus spoke Tlepolemus to his loving wife, and he declared the rest of the damnable deed. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.9.1#[9] “Then Charite, awaking from sleep, began to renew her grief, to tear her garments, and to beat her arms with her comely hands. However, she revealed the vision she saw to no one but, pretending that she knew no part of the mischief, devised with herself how she might take revenge on the traitor, and finish her own sorrowful life. Soon Thrasyllus arrived, the detestable demander of sudden pleasure, and wearied the closed ears of Charite with talk of marriage. But she gently refused his conversation and, dissembling the matter with passing craft in the midst of his earnest desires, said, ‘Thrasyllus, you must understand that the face of your brother and my husband is always before my eyes. I still smell the cinnamon scent of his precious body, I still feel Tlepolemus alive in my heart. Wherefore you will do well if you grant to me, miserable woman, the necessary time to bewail his death until, after the passage of a few months, the year comes to a close. This pertains both to my shame and to your wholesome profit, lest it happen by your speed and quick marriage we should justly raise and provoke the spirit of my husband to work our destruction.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.10.1#[10] “However, Thrasyllus was not content with this promise, but more and more came upon her. Thus she was forced to speak to him in this manner: ‘My friend Thrasyllus, if you can wait until the whole year is complete and finished, behold, here is my body, take your pleasure, but in such a way and so secretly that no servant of the house may perceive it.’ Then Thrasyllus, trusting to the false promises of the woman, and preferring his inordinate pleasure above all things in the world, was joyful in his heart and looked for a night when he might fulfill his desire. ‘Come about midnight,’ said Charite, ‘disguised and without company, and hiss at my chamber door, and my nurse shall attend and let you in.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.11.1#[11] “This counsel pleased Thrasyllus marvelously, who (suspecting no harm) continually yearned for the night and the hour assigned by Charite. The time had scarce come, when (according to her command) he disguised himself and went straight to the chamber where he found the nurse waiting for him. She (by the order of her mistress) fed him with flattering talk, and gave him drugged drink in a cup, excusing the absence of her mistress Charite. She said that she was attending to her father who was sick. Then, with sweet talk and the operation of the wine, he fell sound asleep. Now when he lay prostrate and exposed on the ground, Charite (being called for) came in, and with manly courage and bold force stood over the sleeping murderer and said: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.12.1#[12] “‘Behold the faithful companion of my husband, behold this valiant hunter; behold, my dear spouse, this is the hand which shed my blood, this is the heart which devised so many subtle means to work my destruction, these are the eyes that I have ill pleased. Behold now they foreshow their own destiny. Sleep without care, dream that you are in the hands of the merciful, for I will not hurt you with your sword or any other weapon. God forbid that I should slay you as you slew my husband. But your eyes shall fail you, and you shall see no more what you dream of. You shall think the death of your enemy more sweet than your life. You shall see no light, you shall lack the aid of a leader, you shall not have me as you hoped, you shall have no delight of my marriage. You shall not die, and yet living you shall have no joy, but wander between light and darkness as an unsure image. You shall seek for the hand that pricked out your eyes, yet you shall not know whom you should complain of. I will make sacrifice with the blood of your eyes upon the grave of my husband. But what do you gain through my delay? Perhaps you dream that you embrace me in your arms. Leave off the darkness of sleep and awake to receive as penalty the deprivation of your sight. Lift up your face, think about your vengeance and evil fortune, reckon your misery. So pleasant are your eyes to a chaste woman that you shall have blindness as your companion, and an everlasting remorse on your miserable conscience.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.13.1#[13] “When she had spoken these words, she took a great needle from her head and pricked out both his eyes. This done, she by and by took up the naked sword which her husband Tlepolemus was accustomed to wear, and ran throughout all the city like a mad woman towards the tomb of her husband. Then all of us of the house, with all the citizens, ran quickly after her to take the sword out of her hand. But she, clasping the tomb of Tlepolemus, kept us off with her naked weapon, and when she perceived that every one of us wept and lamented, she spoke in this way: ‘I pray you, my friends, weep not, nor lament for me, for I have revenged the death of my husband, I have punished deservedly the wicked breaker of our marriage. Now is it time to seek out my sweet Tlepolemus, and presently with this sword to finish my life.’ <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.14.1#[14] “And after she had related the whole matter, declared the vision which she saw, and told by what means she had deceived Thrasyllus, she, thrusting her sword under her right breast and wallowing in her own blood, at length with manly courage yielded up the ghost. Then immediately the friends of miserable Charite buried her body within the same tomb. Thrasyllus, hearing all the matter and not knowing not by what means he might end his life (for he thought his sword was not sufficient to revenge so great a crime), at length went to the same tomb and cried with a loud voice, saying: ‘O you dead spirits whom I have so highly and greatly offended, vouchsafe to receive me. Behold I make sacrifice to you with my whole body.’ This said, he closed the tomb, purposing to famish himself, and to finish his life there in sorrow.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.15.1#[15] These things the young man, with pitiful sighs and tears, declared to the cowherds and shepherds, which caused them all to weep. But they, fearing to become subject to new masters, prepared to depart. By and by the groom, to whom the charge of me was committed, brought forth all his possessions, and loaded me and other horses with them, and so departed thence. We bore women, children, pullets, sparrows, kids, whelps, and other things that were not able to keep pace with us. The burden I bore upon my back, although it was a mighty burden, seemed very light because I was driven away from him who most terribly had appointed to kill me. When we had passed over a great mountain full of trees, and had come again into the open fields, behold, we approached near to a fair and rich castle where, it was told to us, we were not able to pass in our journey that night, because of the great number of terrible wolves that were in the area. The wolves were so fierce and cruel that they put every man in fear, such that they could invade and set upon those who passed by like thieves, and devour both them and their beasts. Moreover, we were told that there lay in our path many dead bodies eaten and torn by the wolves. Wherefore we were forced to stay there all night and, the next morning, to proceed close together so that we might escape all dangers. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.16.1#[16] But (notwithstanding this good counsel) our wretched drivers were so covetous to go forward, and so fearful of pursuit that they did not wait until the morning. But being nearly midnight, they made us trudge our way apace. Then I, fearing the potential danger, ran amongst the other horses so that I might defend and save my poor buttocks from the wolves. Every man marveled to see that I ran more swiftly then the other horses. But such was my agility, not to obtain any praise, but rather for fear. At that time I remembered that the valiant horse Pegasus flew in the air more to avoid the danger of the dreadful Chimera than for anything else. The shepherds who drove us before them were well-armed like warriors:.One had a spear, another had a sheep hook, some had darts, some clubs, some gathered up great stones, some held up their sharp javelins, and some frightened off the wolves with lighted firebrands. Finally we lacked nothing to make up an army except drums and trumpets. But when we had fearfully passed these dangers, we happened to fall into worse. The wolves did not come upon us, either because of the great multitude of our company, or else because of our firebrands, or perhaps they had gone to some other place, for we could see none. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.17.1#[17] However, the inhabitants of the next village (supposing that we were thieves by reason of our great number), in order to defend their own possessions and out of fear, sent great and mighty dogs upon us, which they had kept and nourished for the safety of their houses. These dogs, surrounding us, leaped on every side, tearing us with their teeth such that they pulled many of us to the ground. Verily it was a pitiful sight to see so many dogs, some following those who fled, some attacking those who stood still, some tearing those who lay prostrate. Generally there were none who escaped clear. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.18.1#[18] Behold, after this another danger ensued. The inhabitants of the town stood in their garrets and windows, and threw great stones on our heads. Thus we could not tell whether it was best for us to avoid the gaping mouths of the dogs at hand or the peril of the stones from afar. Among the townspeople there was one that hurled a great stone at a woman who sat upon my back. She cried out piteously, and asked her husband to help her. Then he (coming to aid his wife) began to speak as follows: “Alas, masters, why do you trouble us poor working men so cruelly? Why do you take revenge on us, who do you no harm? What do you think you will gain from us? You do not dwell in caves or dens. You are not barbarous people who delight in effusion of human blood.” At these words the tempest of stones ceased, and the storm of dogs vanished. Then one of them (standing on the top of a great cypress tree) spoke to us: “Don’t think, masters, that we do this to rifle or take away any of your goods, but in order to safeguard ourselves and families. Now in God’s name you may depart away.” So we went forward, some wounded by stones, some bitten by dogs, and overall no one escaped unscathed. When we had gone a good way, we came to a certain wood containing great trees and surrounded by pleasant meadows. Our company of shepherds decided to go to this place in order to cure their wounds and sores. Then they sat down on the ground to refresh their weary minds, and afterwards they sought medicine to heal their bodies. Some washed away their blood with the water from the river. Some stopped their wounds with sponges and cloths. In this manner everyone provided for his own well-being. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.19.1#[19] In the meantime we perceived an old man who seemed to be a shepherd, by reason of the goats and sheep that grazed around him. Then one of our company demanded whether he had any milk, butter, or cheese to sell. He answered, saying: “Do you look for any food or drink, or any other refection here? Don’t you know you where you are?” And thereupon he took his sheep and drove them away as fast as he could. This answer made our shepherds greatly afraid, such that they thought of nothing else but to enquire what country they were in. However they saw no one whom they might ask. They were thus in doubt for a long time. Then they perceived another old man with a staff in his hand and very weary with travel, who was drawing near our company. He began to weep and complain saying: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.20.1#[20] “Alas, masters, I pray you help me, a miserable wretch, and restore my nephew to me again. He, by following a sparrow flying before him, fell into a ditch nearby, and verily I think he is in danger of death. As for me, I am not able to help him because of my old age. But you, who are so valiant and lusty, may easily help me, and deliver me my boy, my heir and the guide of my life. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.21.1#[21] These words made us all pity him. And then the youngest and stoutest of our company, who alone escaped least harmed from the recent skirmish with the dogs and stones, rose up and demanded in what ditch the boy had fallen. He said, “Indeed, over yonder,” and pointed with his finger. Our companion accompanied the old man to a great thicket of bushes and thorns which they both entered. In the meantime, after we cured our wounds, we took up our packs, intending to depart. And because we did not want to go away without our young companion, the shepherds whistled and called for him. But when he gave no answer, they sent one of our company to seek him out. He after a while returned again with a pale face and sorrowful news, saying that he saw a terrible dragon eating and devouring their companion. And, as for the old man, he could see him nowhere. When they heard this, (remembering likewise the words of the first old man who had shaken his head and driven away his sheep) they ran away beating us before them, to fly from this deserted and pestilent country. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.22.1#[22] After we had passed a great part of our journey, we came to a village where we rested all night. But hearken, and I will tell you what mischief happened there. You shall understand there was a servant whom his master had placed in charge of his house, and was master of the lodging where we rested. This servant had married a maiden of the same house, but was greatly in love with a harlot from the town, and accustomed to meet with her. His wife was so highly displeased with this and became so jealous that she gathered together all her husband’s possessions, with his books of account, and threw them into a fire. She was not content with this, but she took a cord and bound her child, which she had by her husband, about her middle and cast her self headlong into a deep pit. The master, taking the death of these two badly, took his servant, whose wanton behavior was the cause of this murder, and, after he had taken off all his clothing, he anointed his body with honey, and then bound him to a fig-tree. In a rotten stalk of this tree a great number of ants had built their nests. The ants, after they had smelled the sweetness of the honey came upon his body and little by little (in continuance of time) devoured all his flesh. Thus there remained on the tree nothing but his bare bones: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.23.1#[23] This was declared to us by the inhabitants of the village there, who greatly sorrowed for the death of this servant. Then we, likewise wanting to avoid this dreadful lodging quickly departed. After this we came to a fair city, very populous, where our shepherds determined enter, since it seemed a place where they might live unknown and far from those who would pursue them. They also thought that it was a country very plentiful of grain and other victuals. After we had stayed the space of three days, I, poor ass, and the other horses were fed and kept in the stable to so that we might seem more saleable. We were brought out at length to the market, and soon a crier sounded his horn to signify that we were to be sold. All my companion horses were bought up by gentlemen, but I remained there forsaken of all men. And many buyers came by and looked in my mouth to know mine age. I was so weary with opening my jaws that at length (unable to endure any longer) when one came with a stinking pair of hands and grated my gums with his filthy fingers, I bit them clean off. This caused the bystanders to forsake me as a fierce and cruel beast. The crier, when he had gotten a hoarse voice, and saw that no man would buy me, began to mock me saying, “Why do we stand here with this wild ass, this feeble beast, this slow nag with worn-out hooves, good for nothing but to make sieves from his skin? Why do we not give him away to somebody since he does not earn his hay? <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.24.1#[24] In this manner he made all the bystanders laugh exceedingly. But my evil fortune which was ever so cruel to me, which I having traversed so many countries could in no way escape, assailed me even more. It devised new means to afflict my poor body by giving me a new master, as spiteful as the rest. There was an old man somewhat bald, with long and gray hair, who was one of those that go from door to door throughout all the villages, bearing the image of a Syrian goddess Syria. These people play with cymbals in order to get the alms from good and charitable folks. This old man came hastily towards the crier and demanded where I was bred. “In Cappadocia,” he answered. Then he enquired what age I was. The crier answered that the mathematician who took my horoscope said I was five years old. Then he and told the old man to look in my mouth. He continued: “For I would not willingly incur the penalty of the Cornelian law byselling a free citizen as a servile slave. In God’s name just buy this fair beast to ride home and about the country.” But this curious buyer never stopped asking about my qualities, and at length he demanded whether I was gentle or not. <br><br>

He will never bite, he will never kick, but you would think that under the shape of an ass there was some well-advised man. Indeed this you may easily see, for if you thrust your nose in his tail you shall perceive how patient he is. Thus the crier mocked the old man but he, perceiving his taunts and jests, grew very angry and said, “Away you foolish crier! I pray the omnipotent Syrian goddess, parent to all, sacred Sabazius, Bellona, the mother of Ida, and Venus with Adonis, to strike out both your eyes, since you with have scoffed at me with taunts. Do you think that I would put the goddess upon the back of a fierce beast, such that her divine image might be thrown down on the ground? Thus I, poor wretch, would be compelled (tearing my hair) to look for a physician to help her!” When I heard him speak thus, I thought that I should suddenly leap upon him like a mad ass, in order to prevent him from buying me. But soon the buyer prevented this by quickly offering seventeen denars for me. My master was glad and received the money, and delivered me to my new master, who was called Philebus. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.26.1#[26] This priest brought me home, and when he came to his house he called out his daughters saying, “Behold my daughters what a gentle servant I have bought for you!” But the daughters were really catamite men. They were at first very happy and, coming out shouting for joy, were thinking that Philebus had brought home a fit and amenable servant for their purposes. But when they perceived that I was an ass, they began to provoke him, saying that he had not bought a servant for his maidens but rather a spouse for himself. They said, “However, do not keep him wholly for your own riding, but let us likewise have him at our command.” Thereupon they led me into the stable and tied me to the manger. There was a certain young man with a mighty body, skilled at playing on instruments to get money who (as soon as he had saw me) entertained me very well. He filled my manger full of food, and spoke merrily saying, “O master ass, I pray to God you live a long time and please my master well so that you may continually deliver me from so great pain.” When I heard these words I foresaw for myself more misery to come. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.27.1#[27] The following day I saw a great number of persons appareled in various colors and having painted faces, miters on their heads, vestments colored like saffron, and scarves of silk. On their feet were yellow shoes. These people attired the image of the goddess in a purple robe and put her on my back. Then they went forth with their arms naked to their shoulders, bearing great swords and mighty axes, and dancing like mad persons. After they had passed many small villages, they happened to come to the house of some wealthy person. Upon entering they began to hurl themselves hither and thither as though they were mad. They made a thousand gestures with their feet and hands, they would bite themselves. Finally everyone took his own weapon and wounded his own arms in various places. Amongst them was one more mad then the rest, who uttered many deep sighs from the bottom of his heart, as though he had been possessed in spirit or filled with divine power. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.28.1#[28] Afterward, having somewhat returned to himself, he invented and forged a great lie, saying, that he had displeased the divine majesty of the goddess by doing something which was not allowed by their holy religion. Wherefore he said he would punish himself. Thereupon he took a whip and scourged his own body such that the blood issued out abundantly. It caused me great fear to see such wounds and effusion of blood, lest the same goddess, desiring so much the blood of men, should likewise desire the blood of an ass. After they grew weary with hurling and beating themselves, they sat down and behold, the inhabitants came in, and offered gold, silver, vessels of wine, milk, cheese, flour, wheat and other things. Amongst these people there was one who brought barley for the ass that carried the goddess. But the greedy whoresons thrust it all into their sack, which they had brought for the purpose, and put it upon my back. Thus I could serve two purposes, that is to say, as a barn by reason of my grain, and as a temple by reason of the statue. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.29.1#[29] In this way they went from place to place, robbing all the country over. At length they came to a certain castle where, under pretense of divination, they obtained a fat sheep from a poor husbandman for the goddess’ supper and to make sacrifice with. After that the banquet was prepared, they washed their bodies and brought in a tall young man of the village to dine with them. He had scarcely tasted his pottage when he began to discover their beastly customs and inordinate desire of luxury. For they surrounded the young man as he sat at the table and abused him, contrary to all nature and reason. When I beheld this horrible deed, I wanted to say, “O citizens!” But I could only pronounce the first letter O, which I roared out so valiantly that the young men of the town, seeking for a stray ass that they had lost the same night, and hearing my voice, whereby they judged that I was theirs. They entered the house unawares and found these persons committing their vile abomination. When they saw what was going on, they declared to all the inhabitants nearby their unnatural villainy, mocking and laughing at this the pure and clean chastity of their religion. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.30.1#[30] In the meantime Phelibus and his company (by reason of the rumor of their beastly wickedness which was dispersed throughout all the region there) put all their equipment upon my back and departed away about midnight. When we had passed a great part of our journey, before the rising of the sun, we came into a wild desert where they conspired together to slay me. For after they had taken the goddess from my back and set her gingerly upon the ground, they likewise took off my harness and bound me surely to an oak, beating me with their whip in such a way that I nearly died. Amongst these men there was one who threatened to cut off my legs with his hatchet, because by my noise I defamed his chastity. But the others, considering more their own profit than my utility, thought it best to spare my life because I could carry home the goddess. So they loaded me up again and drove me before them with their naked swords until they came to a noble city. Here the principal citizen, bearing high reverence for the goddess, came with great devotion before us with drums, cymbals, and other instruments, and received her and all our company with much sacrifice and veneration. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:8.31.1#[31] But there I remember I thought I was in most danger, for there was one who brought to the master of the house a side of a fat buck for a present. This was hanging behind the kitchen door not far from the ground, and was clean eaten up by a greyhound that had come in. The cook, when he saw the venison had been devoured, lamented and wept pitifully. And because supper time approached, in order to avoid being reproved of too much negligence, he took up a halter to hang himself. But his wife, perceiving what he was doing, ran quickly up to him and, taking the halter in both her hands, stopped him of his intent, saying, “O husband, are you out of your mind? Follow my counsel: carry this strange ass out into some secret place and kill him. This done, cut off one of his sides and sauce it well like the side of the buck, and set it before your master.” Then the cook, hearing the counsel of his wife, was well pleased to slay me and to save himself. And so he went to the whetstone to sharpen his tools accordingly. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.1.1#[1] In this manner the traitorous cook prepared to slay me. When he was ready with his knives to do the deed, I thought to myself how I might escape the present peril and I did not long delay. Quickly I broke the halter with which I was tied and, flinging my heels hither and thither to save myself, at length I ran hastily into a parlor where the master of the house was feasting with the priests of the Syrian goddess. I disturbed the whole company, throwing down their food and drink from the table. The master of the house, dismayed at my great disorder, commanded one of his servants to take me and lock me in some strong place so that I might not disturb them any more. But I cared little for my imprisonment, thinking that I was happily saved from the hands of the traitorous cook. However, fortune, or the fatal disposition of the divine providence which can be avoided neither by wise counsel nor by any wholesome remedy, invented a new torment for me. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.2.1#[2] By and by a young lad came running into the parlor all trembling, and declared to the master of the house that there was a mad dog running about in the streets. This dog had done much harm, for he had bitten many greyhounds and horses in the inn nearby, and he spared neither man nor beast. Myrtilus the muleteer, Hephaestio the cook, Hypnophilus the chamberlain, and Apollonius the physician, thinking they could chase away the mad dog, were cruelly wounded by him, and so many horses and other beasts, infected with the venom of his poisonous teeth, became mad likewise. This caused all who were at the table greatly to fear. Thinking that I too had been bitten, they came out with spears, clubs, and pitchforks in order to slay me. I would have undoubtedly been slain, had I not by and by crept into the chamber where my master intended to lodge all night. Then they closed and locked fast the doors about me and kept the chamber surrounded until such time as they thought that the pestilent rage of madness had killed me. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.3.1#[3] While I was thus shut in the chamber alone, I lay down upon the bed to sleep, considering it was long time past since I lay and took my rest as humans do. When morning came, I was well reposed and rose up lustily. In the meantime, they who were appointed to watch about the chamber all night reasoned with themselves as follows: “Should we think,” said one, “that this rude ass is still possessed by madness?” “Nay,” said another, “for the outrageous poison of madness has killed him.” But, being thus of differing opinions as to a poor ass, they looked through a crack in the door and espied me standing still, sober and quiet, in the middle of the chamber. Then they opened the doors and came towards me in order to determine whether I was gentle or no. Amongst them there was one who, in my opinion, was sent from heaven to save my life. He ordered the other to set a basin of fresh water before me, and thereby they would know whether I were mad or not. If I drank without fear as I accustomed to do, it was a sign that I was whole and in possession of my ass-like wits. But if I avoided and abhorred the taste of the water, it was evident proof of my madness. This, he said, he had read in ancient and credible books. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.4.1#[4] Whereupon they took a basin of clear water and presented it to me. As soon as I perceived the wholesome water, I ran up quickly, thrusting my head into the basin, and drank as though I had been extremely thirsty. Then they stroked me with their hands and bowed mine ears and took me by the halter, to prove my patience. But I, taking each thing in good part, disproved their mad presumption by my meek and gentle behavior. When I was thus saved from this double danger, the next day I was loaded again with the Syrian goddess and other equipment, and was brought into the road with trumpets and cymbals. We went to beg in the villages which we passed by according to our custom. And after we had gone through a few towns and castles, we happened to come to a certain village, which was built (as the inhabitants there affirm) upon the foundation of a famous ancient city. And after we had turned into the next inn, we heard of a pretty story committed in the town there, which I would have you know likewise. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.5.1#[5] There was a man dwelling in the town, very poor, that had nothing but that which he got by the labor and travail of his hands. His wife was a fair young woman, but very lascivious, and given to the appetite and desire of the flesh. It happened on a day that while this poor man was gone in the morning to the field about his business, as he was accustomed to do, his wife’s lover secretly came into his house to have his pleasure with her. And so it chanced that during the time that she and he were basking together, her husband, suspecting no such matter, returned home. He praised the chaste continence of his wife, in that he found his doors locked. Wherefore, as was his custom, he whistled to declare his approach. Then his crafty wife, ready with shifts, caught her lover up and covered him under a great tub standing in a corner. Thereupon she opened the door, blaming her husband in this way: “Do you come home everyday with empty hands, and bring nothing to maintain our house? You have no regard for our profit, nor do you provide any food or drink, whereas I, poor wretch, do nothing day and night but occupy myself with spinning. Yet my travail will scarce buy the candles we need. O how much more happy is my neighbor Daphne, who eats and drinks at her pleasure and passes the time with her amorous lovers according to her desire.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.6.1#[6] “What is the matter?” said her husband, “Though our master has been called into court, don’t think that I have made no provision for our supper. Do you not see this tub that takes up space here in our house and does us no service? Behold, I have sold it to a good fellow (that is here present) for six denars. Wherefore lend me a hand so that I may give him the tub. His wife (having devised what to do) laughed at her husband, saying: “What merchant, I pray you, have you brought home to fetch away my tub for six denars? I, poor woman, who sits all day alone in my house, have been offered seven.” Her husband, being well-disposed to her words, demanded who had bought the tub. “Look,” she said, “he is underneath it to see where it is sound or not.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.7.1#[7] Then her lover (who was under the tub) began to stir, and so his words might agree with the words of the woman, he said: “Dame, to tell you the truth, this tub is rotten and cracked, it seems to me, on every side.” And then, turning to her husband, said: “I pray you, honest man, light a candle so that I may clean the inside of the tub and see if it useful or not. For I do not intend to cast away my money blindly.” By and by the husband (as dumb as an ox) lit a candle, saying, “I pray you, good brother, don’t put yourself to so much trouble. Let me clean the tub and ready it for you. Whereupon he took off his coat and crept under the tub to rub away the filth from the insides. In the meantime this minion lover cast his wife on the bottom of the tub and had his pleasure with her right above his head. While she was thus occupied she managed to point out to her husband all the parts of the tub that needed cleaning. When everyone had finished their business, the lover gave seven denars for the tub, and caused the good man himself to carry it on his back to his inn. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.8.1#[8] We stayed there a few days at the cost of the whole village, and had gotten much money by our divination and prognostication of things to come. The priests of the Syrian goddess invented a new way to pick men’s pockets. They had certain lots on which it was written: “The yoked oxen plow the fields so that in the future the blessed seed may grow.” By these kind of lots they deceive many of the simple sort. For if someone demanded whether he should take a good wife or not, they would say that his lot testified that he should, namely that he should be yoked to a good woman and have increase of children. If someone demanded whether he should buy lands and possession, they said that he would have much ground that would yield his increase. If someone demanded whether he would have a good and prosperous voyage, they said he would have good success and would increase his profit. If someone demanded whether he would be able to vanquish his enemies and prevail in pursuit of thieves, they said that this enemy would be tied and yoked to him and his pursuits after thieves would be prosperous. Thus, by telling fortunes, they gathered a great quantity of money. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.9.1#[9] But when they were weary of giving answers, they drove me away next night through a lane which was more dangerous and stony than the way which we went the night before. On the one side there were quagmires and foggy marshes, on the other side were falling trenches and ditches. Thus my legs failed me, such that I could scarcely come to the level paths. And behold, by and by a great company of inhabitants of the town, armed with weapons and on horseback, overtook us and immediately arrested Philebus and his priests. They tied them by the necks and beat them cruelly, calling them thieves and robbers. After they had manacled their hands the said: “Show us the cup of gold which (under the guise of your solemn religion) you have taken away. Do you now think you can escape in the night without punishment for your deed?” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.10.1#[10] By and by one of them came towards me and, thrusting his hand into the bosom of the goddess, brought out the cup which the priests had stolen. However, even though they were caught red-handed, they would not be confounded nor abashed. But, jesting and laughing about the matter, they said: “Is it right, masters, that you should thus rigorously interrogate and threaten us for a small trifling cup, which the mother of the goddess determined to give to her sister for a present?” However, for all their lies and complaints, they were carried back to the town and put in prison by the inhabitants who, taking the cup of gold and the goddess which I bore, placed and consecrated them amongst the treasure of the temple. The next day I was conveyed to the market to be sold, and my price was set at seven sesterces more then Philebus had given for me. There a baker from the next village happened to pass by who, after that he had bought a great deal of grain, bought me likewise to carry it home. When he had loaded me with the grain, be drove me through a thorny and dangerous way to his bakery. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.11.1#[11] There I saw a great company of horses who went to the mill, day and night, to grind the grain. But lest I should be discouraged at the first, my master entertained me well. For the first day I did nothing but fare daintily. However, such ease and felicity did not long endure, for the next day I was tied to the mill with my face covered so that, in going round so often in one direction, I should not become giddy and keep a straight course. Although when I was a man I had seen many such horse mills and knew well enough how they worked, yet feigning my to be ignorant of such kind of toil, I stood still and would not go. I thought I would be taken from the mill as a useless ass and put to some other light work, or else to be driven into the fields to pasture. But my subtlety did me little good, for by and by when the mill stood still, the servants came in shouting and beat me forward, in such sort that I applied myself vigorously to the work at hand. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.12.1#[12] Whereupon all the company laughed to see so sudden a change. When a good part of the day had past, and when I was not able to endure any longer, they took off my harness and tied me to the manger. But although my bones were weary and I needed to refresh myself with rest and provender, yet I was so curious that I did greatly delight to behold the baker’s art, so much so that I could not eat nor drink while I looked on. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.12.2#O good Lord, what a sort of poor slaves were there! Some had their skin black and blue, some had their backs striped with lashes, some were covered with rugged sacks, some had their members just barely hidden. Some wore such ragged clothing that you might perceive all their naked bodies. Some were marked and burned in the heads with hot irons, some had their hair half-clipped, some had locks on their legs. Some were very ugly and evil-favored, and they could scarcely see because their eyes and face were so black and dim with smoke. They looked like those that fight in the sands and do not know where they strike because of the dust. And some had their faces all covered with flour. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.13.1#[13] But how could I describe the horses who were my companions? How they, being old and weak, thrust their heads into the manger? They had their necks all wounded and worn away, they opened their nostrils with a continual cough, their sides were bare because of the harness and great travail, their ribs were broken with beating, their hooves were battered broad with incessant labor, and their skin was rugged because of their weakness. When I saw this dreadful sight, I began to fear least I should arrive in a similar state. And considering with the good fortune which I was in when I was a man, I greatly lamented, holding down my head, and would eat no food. I saw no comfort or consolation in my evil fortune except that my mind was somewhat restored to hear and understand what every man said, for they neither feared nor hesitated in my presence. At that time I remembered how Homer, the divine author of ancient poetry, described the a wise man, who had traveled through different countries and nations. Wherefore I gave great thanks to my ass-form since I could see and experience many things, and became more wise (notwithstanding the great misery and labor which I daily sustained): <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.14.1#[14] But I will tell you a pretty story that comes now to my memory, so that your ears may be delighted in hearing it. The baker who had bought me was an honest and sober man. But his wife was the most pestilent woman in all the world such that he endured many miseries and afflictions because of her. I myself came secretly to pity his situation and bewail his evil fortune. For she had not just a single fault, but all the mischief that could be devised. She was crabbed, cruel, lascivious, drunken, obstinate, greedy, covetous, riotous in filthy expenses, and an enemy to faith and chastity. She despised all the gods whom others honored, but she affirmed that she believed in a single god. Thus she deceived all men, and especially her poor husband. She had abandoned her body with continual whoredom. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.15.1#[15] This mischievous queen hated me in such a way that she commanded everyday, before she was up, that I should he put into the mill to grind. The first thing she would do in the morning was to see me cruelly beaten, and to order that I should grind while the other beasts fed and took rest. When I saw that I was so cruelly handled, she gave me occasion to learn her conversation and life, for I saw oftentimes a young man who would secretly go into her chamber. His face I greatly desired to see but I could not because my eyes were covered everyday. And verily, if I had been free and at liberty, I would have discovered all her abomination. She had an old woman, a bawd, a messenger of mischief, that daily haunted to her house, and made good cheer with her to the utter undoing and impoverishment of her husband. But I, who was greatly offended by the negligence of Fotis (who made me an ass instead of a bird), took comfort in this alone: in the miserable deformity of my shape, I had long ears, whereby I might hear all things that were done. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.16.1#[16] One day I heard the old bawd say to the baker’s wife: “Dame, you have chosen (without my counsel) a young man as your lover who, as it seems to me, is dull, fearful, without any grace, and cowers before the frowning look of your odious husband. Whereby you have no delight nor pleasure with him. How mush better is the young man Philesitherus! He is comely, beautiful, in the flower of his youth, generous, courteous, valiant and stout against the diligent prying of your husband. His is worthy to embrace the worthiest dames of this country, and worthy to wear a crown of gold, for one part he did to a man who was jealous over his wife. Hearken how it was and then judge the difference between these two lovers: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.17.1#[17] “Do you not know of one Barbarus, a Senator of our town, whom the vulgar people call likewise Scorpion for his severity of manners? This Barbarus had a gentlewoman for his wife whom he caused daily to be locked up in his house under diligent guard.” Then the baker’s wife said, “I know her very well, for we two lived together in one house.” “Then you know,” said the old woman, “the whole tale of Philesitherus?” “No verily,” said the wife, “but I greatly desire to know it. Therefore I pray you, mother, tell me the whole story.” By and by the old woman, who knew well how to babble, began to tell the story as follows. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.17.2#“You shall understand that one day this Barbarus preparing to ride abroad and, wanting to safeguard the chastity of his wife (whom he so well loved), called his man Myrmex (whose loyalty he had tried and proved in many things) and secretly committed to him the custody of his wife. Barbarus told him that he should threaten, if any man tried to touch her with his finger as he passed by, not only to put him in prison and bind him hand and foot, but also to cause him to be put to death, or else to be starved for lack of sustenance. These words he confirmed by an oath to all the gods in heaven. Then he departed. When Barbarus had gone, Myrmex, being greatly astonished by his master’s threats, would not allow his mistress to go abroad but, as she sat all day spinning, he was careful to sat near her. When night came he went with her to the baths, holding her by the garment. So faithful was he to fulfill the commands of his master. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.18.1#[18] “However, the beauty of this matron could not be hidden from the burning eyes of Philesitherus. He, considering her great chastity and how she was diligently kept by Myrmex, thought it impossible to obtain his purpose. Nevertheless he tried by all kind of means to fulfill his desire and, remembering the fragility of man (who might be enticed and corrupted with money) he remembered that by gold even adamant gates may be opened. One day, when he found Myrmex alone, he revealed his love and asked him to show his favor. He said that otherwise he would certainly die. He assured him that he need not to fear since he might be let in and out secretly at night, without knowledge of any person. When he perceived that, with these and other gentle words, he was alluring and pricking forward the obstinate mind of Myrmex, he showed him glittering gold, saying that he would give his mistress twenty gold pieces and him ten. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.19.1#[19] “But Myrmex, hearing these words, was greatly troubled. He abhorred in his mind to commit such a mischief. Wherefore he covered his ears and, turning his head, departed. However, he could never put the sight of the glittering coins out of his mind but, when he was at home, he seemed to see the money before his eyes and he thought it worth taking. Wherefore poor Myrmex was of diverse opinions and could not tell what to do. For on the one side he considered the promise which he made to his master, and the punishment that would ensue if he did contrary. On the other side he thought of the gain and the passing pleasure of gold. In the end the desire for the money prevailed over the fear of death. The beauty of the glittering gold so stuck in his mind that, where the menaces of his master compelled him to stay at home, the pestilent avarice of gold egged him outdoors. Wherefore, putting all shame aside, without further delay, he declared the whole matter to his mistress. She, according to the nature of a woman, when she heard him speak of so great a sum, she bound chastity in a string, and gave authority to Myrmex to rule her in that case. Myrmex, seeing the intent of his mistress, was very glad and, because of his great desire for the gold, he ran hastily to Philesitherus and declared that his mistress had consented. Wherefore he demanded the gold which he been promised. Immediately Philesitherus gave him ten gold pieces. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.20.1#[20] When night came, Myrmex brought him disguised into his mistress’ chamber. About midnight, when he and she were naked together and making sacrifice to the goddess Venus, behold, her husband (contrary to their expectation) came and knocked at the door, calling with a loud voice to his servant Myrmex. Myrmex’ long delay increased the suspicion of his master such that he threatened to beat Myrmex cruelly. But he, greatly afraid and driven to desperate measure, excused the matter, saying that he could not find the key because it was so dark. In the meantime Philesitherus, hearing the noise at the door, slipped on his coat and quietly ran out of the chamber. When Myrmex had opened the door to his master (who had threatened him terribly) and had let him in, he went into the chamber to his wife. Meanwhile Myrmex let out Philesitherus and barred the doors fast. Then he went again to bed. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.21.1#[21] “The next morning when Barbarus awaked, he perceived two unknown slippers lying under his bed, which Philesitherus had forgotten when he went away. Then he conceived a great suspicion and jealousy in mind. However, he did not reveal it to his wife or to any other person. But he, putting the slippers secretly into his bosom, commanded his other servants to bind Myrmex immediately and to bring him to court. He thought that by the means of the slippers he might get him to admit the whole matter. It happened that while Barbarus went towards the magistrate in a fury and rage and Myrmex, bound fast, followed him weeping (not because he was accused before his master, but because of his own guilty conscience) behold, it happened that Philesitherus (going about earnest business) met with them in the street. He, fearing the deed he committed the night before and not wanting it to be known, suddenly devised a means to get Myrmex off the hook. He ran up to him and beat him about the head with his fists, saying: “Ah mischievous varlet and perjured knave! It is a good deed if the goddess and your master here would put you to death! For you should be imprisoned and wear these irons since you stole my slippers when you were at the baths last night. Barbarus, hearing this, immediately returned home and commanded his servant Myrmex to deliver the slippers again to the right owner.” <br><br>

But as for me, poor wretch, I have fallen into the hands of a coward who is not only afraid of my husband but also of every clap of the mill. He doesn’t dare to do anything in front of the blind face of yonder scabbed ass.” Then the old woman answered, “I promise you certainly that if you want him, you shall have this young man at your pleasure.” Thereupon, when night came, she departed from her chamber. In the meantime, the baker’s wife made ready a supper with abundance of wine and exquisite fare. Thus there lacked nothing except the arrival of the young man. Her husband was having dinner at one of their neighbor’s houses. When the time came that my harness was to be taken off and that I should rest, I felt joy because, when the veil was taken from my eyes, I would be able see all the abomination of this mischievous queen. When night had come and the sun had gone down, behold, the old bawd and the young man, who seemed to be but a child (he had no beard), came to the door. Then the baker’s wife kissed him a thousand times and received him courteously and set him down at the table: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.23.1#[23] But he had scarcely eaten the first morsel when the good man (contrary to his wife’s expectation) returned home. She thought he would not have come so soon. But Lord how she cursed him, praying God that he might break his neck upon his first entry. In the meantime, she took her lover and thrust him into the bin where she stored her flour and, dissembling the matter, came to her husband demanding why he came home so soon. He said, “I could not abide to see the great mischief and wicked fact that my neighbor’s wife committed, but I had to leave. O, harlot as she is, how she has dishonored her husband! I swear by the goddess Ceres that if I had not seen it with my own eyes, I would never I have believed it.” His wife, desirous to know the matter, asked him to tell what she had done. Then he accorded to the request of his wife and, ignorant of matters in his own house, declared the mischance of another. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.24.1#[24] “You shall understand,” he said, “that the wife of the fuller, my companion, who seemed to me a wise and chaste woman regarding her own honesty and profit of her house, was found this night with her lover. For while we went to wash our hands, he and she were together. They, being troubled with our presence, ran into a corner. She thrust him into a cage made with twigs which was used to lay clothes on to make them white with the smoke of fume and brimstone. Then she sat down with us at the table to conceal the matter. In the meantime the young man, hidden in the cage, could not keep from sneezing due to the smoke of the brimstone. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.25.1#[25] The good man, thinking it had been his wife that sneezed, cried, “Bless you.” But when the young man sneezed more, the fuller suspected the matter and, wanting to know who it was, rose from the table, and went to the cage. There he found a young man, nearly dead with smoke. When he understood the whole matter, he was so inflamed with anger that he called for a sword to kill him. Undoubtedly he would have killed him, if I had not restrained his violent hands from his purpose. I assured him that his enemy would die by the force of his brimstone and without the harm he would do. However, my words would not appease his fury, but as necessity required he took the young man, nearly choked, and carried him outside. In the meantime, I advised his wife to absent herself to one of her neighbor’s houses until the anger of her husband was pacified. I said this lest he should be moved against her as he was against the young man. And so, being weary of their supper, I immediately returned home.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.26.1#[26] When the baker had told his tale, his impudent wife began to curse and abhor the wife of the fuller, as well as all other wives in general who give away their bodies to any man except their own husbands, breaking the faith and bond of marriage. Then she said they deserved to be burned alive. But knowing her own guilty conscience and proper whoredom, and lest her lover should be hurt lying in the bin, she asked her husband to go to bed. But he, having eaten nothing, said that he wanted to dine before he went to rest. Whereupon she was compelled to set such things on the table as she had prepared for her lover. But I, considering the great mischief of this wicked queen, devised how I might reveal the matter to my master. I thought I would kick away the cover of the bin (where, like a snail, the young-man was hidden) to make her whoredome apparent and known. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.27.1#[27] At length I was aided by the providence of God, for there was an old man to whom the custody of us was committed. He drove me, poor ass, and the other horses at the same time to water to drink. Then I found a good opportunity to revenge the injury of my master. For as I passed by, I perceived the fingers of the young man on the side of the bin. Lifting up my heels, I scraped off the flesh with the force of my hoofs, whereby he was compelled to cry out, and to throw the bin to the ground. Thus the whoredom of the baker’s wife was known and revealed. The baker, seeing this, was not a little moved at the dishonesty of his wife. But he took the young man, trembling with fear, by the hand and with cold and courteous words spoke in this way: “Fear not, my son, nor think that I am so barbarous or cruel a person that I would stifle you with the smoke of sulfur as our neighbor did. I will not punish you according to the rigor of the Julian law, which commands that adulterers should be put to death. No, no. I will not execute my cruelty against so fair and comely a young man as you are. We will divide our pleasure between us by lying, all three of us, in one bed. Thus there will be no dissention between us, and both of us may be contented. For I have always lived with my wife in such tranquility that, according to the saying of wise men, whatsoever I say she must obey, and indeed equity will not suffer, but that the husband should bear more authority then the wife.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.28.1#[28] With these and like words he led the young man to his chamber, and closed his wife in another chamber. That night he enjoyed the young man and thus took revenge on his wife. The next morning he called two of the sturdiest servants of his house who held up the young man, while he scourged his buttocks deservedly with rods, like a child. When he had well beaten him, he said: “Are you not ashamed, you tender and delicate child, to desire the violation of honest marriages, and to defame yourself with wicked living, and so to acquire the name of adulterer?” After he had spoken these and like words, he whipped him again and chased him out of his house. The young man, who was the comeliest of all the adulterers, ran away and did nothing else that night except bewail his striped and painted buttocks. Soon after the baker sent to his wife and divorced her. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.29.1#[29] She was offended by this great humiliation, even though she had worthily deserved it. But she, in addition to her natural mischief, had recourse to wicked arts and trumpery, and never ceased until she had found out an enchantress who (as it was thought) could do whatever she wanted with her sorcery and conjuration. The baker’s wife began to entreat her, promising that she would pay her handsomely if she could bring one of two things to pass: either to make her husband be reconciled with her again, or else, if he should not agree to this, to send an evil spirit into him and to dispossess the spirit of her husband. Then the witch, with her abominable science, began to conjure and to perform her rites in order to turn the heart of the baker to his wife. But all was in vain. Wherefore, considering on the one hand that she could not bring her purpose to pass, and on the other the loss of her fee, she ran hastily to the baker and threatened to send an evil spirit to kill him, using her conjurations. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.30.1#[30] But I suppose some scrupulous reader may ask me how I, being an ass and always tied up in the mill house, could know the secrets of these women. Verily I answer, notwithstanding my shape of an ass, I had the sense and knowledge of a man, and curiously endeavored to find out such injuries as were done to my master. About noon there came a woman into the mill house, very sorrowful, raggedly attired, with bare feet, meager, ill-favored, with her hair scattered upon her face. This woman took the baker by the hand and, feigning that she had some secret matter to tell him, went into a chamber. There they remained a good space, until all the grain was ground. Then as the servants were compelled to call their master to give them more grain, but when they had called very often, and no person gave answer, they began to suspect something was amiss. Therefore they broke open the door. When they came in, they could not find the woman, but found only their master hanging dead from a rafter of the chamber. Whereupon they cried and lamented greatly and, according to the custom, when they had washed themselves, they took the body and buried it. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.31.1#[31] The next day, the daughter of the baker, who had married a little before to a man from the next village, came crying and beating her breast. She did so not because she heard of the death of her father from any man, but because his lamentable spirit, with a halter around his neck, had appeared to her in the night and declared the whole circumstance of his death. He told her how, by enchantment, he had descended into hell. After she had lamented a good space and was somewhat comforted by the servants of the house, and when nine days had passed, she, as heir to her father, sold away all the substance of the house. Thus the goods happened to go to various different men. There was a poor gardener amongst them, and he bought me for the sum of fifty sesterces, which seemed to him a great price, but he thought to recoup the amount through the continual labor of my body. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.32.1#[32] The matter requires to tell how I was handled in his service. This gardener was accustomed to drive me every morning, loaded with herbs, to the next village. When he had sold his herbs, he would mount upon my back and return to the garden. While he dug the ground and watered the herbs, and went about other business, I did nothing but repose myself with great ease. But when winter came with sharp hail, rain and frosts, I stood under a hedge side and was nearly killed with cold. My master was so poor that he had no lodging for himself, much less anything to cover me with. He himself always lay under a little roof shadowed with boughs. In the morning when I arose, I found my hooves shriveled with cold and unable to tread upon the sharp ice and frosty mire. Neither could I fill my belly with food as I was accustomed to do, for my master and I ate together, and had both one fare. However, it was very slender since we had nothing else except old and unsavory greens which had gone to seed, like long brooms, and had lost all their sweet sap and juice. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.33.1#[33] It happened one day that an honest man of the next village was forced by the rain to lodge (very tired and weary) in our garden where, although he was but meanly received, yet it served well enough considering time and necessity. This honest man, to pay us back for our entertainment, promised to give my master some grain, oil, and two bottles of wine. Wherefore my master, not delaying the matter, loaded me with sacks and bottles and rode to the town which was seven miles off. When we came to the honest man’s house, he entertained and feasted my master exceedingly. And it happened while they ate and drank together in honor of their great friendship there chanced something strange and dreadful. For there was a hen which ran cackling about the yard, as though she were about to lay an egg. The good man of the house, perceiving her, said: “O good and profitable pullet, who feeds us every day with your eggs, you seem as though you would give us some pittance for our dinner. Ho boy! Put the pannier in the corner so that the hen may lay.” Then the boy did as his master commanded, but the hen, forsaking the pannier, came toward her master and laid at his feet not an egg, as normal, but a chicken with feathers, claws, and eyes, which immediately ran peeping after its mother. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.34.1#[34] By and by happened an even stranger thing which would cause any man to be afraid. Under the table where they sat the ground opened, and there appeared a great well and fountain of blood. The drops of blood then sprinkled about the table. At the same time, while they wondered at this dreadful sight, one of the servants came running out of the cellar and said that all the wine had boiled out of the vessels as though there had been some great fire underneath. By and by a weasel was seen that brought into the house a dead serpent. Then, out of the mouth of a shepherd’s dog leaped a live frog, and immediately after that someone brought word that a ram had decapitated the same dog with one bite. All these things that happened astonished the good man of the house and the rest of those who were present. So much so that they could not tell what to do or with what sacrifice to appease the anger of the gods. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.35.1#[35] While every man was thus stricken with fear, behold, someone brought word to the good man of the house that his three sons, who had been well-educated and endowed with good manners, were dead. For these three had great acquaintance and old friendship with a poor man who was their neighbor and who lived very close by. And next to him lived another young man. very rich both in lands and goods, but one who used his good family name for ill. He did whatever he wanted to in the town accompanied by his gang. This young man mortally hated the poor man, so much so that he would kill his sheep, steal his oxen, and spoil his grain and other fruits before the time of ripeness. Yet was he not contented with this, but he would encroach upon the poor man’s ground and claim all the property as his own. The poor man, who was very simple and fearful, seeing all his goods taken away by the avarice of the rich man, called together and assembled many of his friends to show them all his land. He did this so that he might have enough ground from his father’s legacy to be buried in. Amongst his friends he found these three brothers who pledged to help and aid him in his adversity and tribulation. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.36.1#[36] However, the presence of these honest citizens could in no wise persuade the greedy youth to stop his extortion, nor yet to cause any moderation of his tongue. But the more they went about with gentle words to tell him his injustices, the more would he fret and likewise fume, swearing all the oaths under God, that he little regarded the presence of the whole city. Whereupon he commanded his servants to take the poor man by the ears and carry him out of his ground, which greatly offended all the bystanders. Then one of the brothers spoke to him somewhat boldly, saying: “It is folly to have such confidence in your riches that you should use your tyranny against the poor. The law is common for all men, and a remedy may be had to suppress your insolence.” These words chafed him more than the burning oil or flaming brimstone or scourge of whips, and so he said that they should be hanged and their law too before he would be subject to any person. Thereupon he called out his bulldogs and great mastiffs which were accustomed to eat the carrion and carcasses of dead beasts in the fields, and to set upon those who passed by. Then he commanded that they should attack the crowd and tear them to pieces. As soon as they heard the hiss of their master, the dogs ran fiercely upon the gathering and attacked them on every side. And indeed, the more they fled, the more cruel and terrible the dogs became. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.37.1#[37] It happened amongst all this that in running, the youngest of the three brothers stumbled on a stone and fell to the ground: Then the dogs came upon him and tore him to pieces with their teeth and he was compelled to cry for aid. His other two brothers, hearing his lamentable voice, ran towards him to help him. They cast their cloaks around their left arms and took up stones to chase away the dogs. But it was all was in vain and they saw their brother dismembered in every part of his body. He, lying at the very point of death, desired his brothers to revenge his death against that cruel tyrant, and thereupon gave up the ghost. The other two brothers, perceiving so great a murder and neglecting their own lives, like desperate persons dressed themselves against the tyrant, and threw a great number of stones at him. But the bloody thief, experienced in such mischief, took a spear and thrust it clean through the body of one of the brothers. However, he did not fall to the ground, for the spear came out at his back and stuck in the ground, thus propping him up. By and by one of the tyrant’s servants, the sturdiest of the rest, came to help his master. He, when he arrived on the scene, took up a stone and threw at the third brother, but the stone grazed his arm and did not hurt him. This happened otherwise than anyone thought. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.38.1#[38] By and by the young man, feigning that his arm was greatly wounded, spoke these words to the cruel blood sucker: “Now you may, wretch, triumph in the destruction of all our family. Now you have fed your insatiable cruelty with the blood of three brothers. Now you may rejoice at the fall of us citizens. Yet do not think that you extend the bounds of your land: you shall have some neighbor still. But how greatly am I sorry that I have lost mine arm whereby I intended to cut off your head.” When he had spoken these words, the furious thief drew out his dagger and, running upon the young man, intended to slay him. But it chanced otherwise. For the young man resisted him stoutly and, in wrestling violently with him, wrested the dagger out of his hand. This done, he killed the rich thief with his own weapon. And in order for the young man to escape the hands of the servants, who came running to assist their master, with the same dagger he cut his own throat. These things were signified by the strange and dreadful portents which occurred in the house of the good man. He, after he had heard these sorrowful tidings, could not even weep, so far was he stricken with grief. But presently, taking the knife with which he was cutting his cheese and other foods, he cut his own throat likewise, such that he fell upon the board and embraced the table with the streams of his blood in most miserable manner. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.39.1#[39] Thus my master the gardener was deprived of his hope and, paying for his dinner with the watery tears of his eyes, he mounted upon my back and so we went homeward the same way as we came. As we passed by the way we met with a tall soldier (for so his bearing and countenance declared) who with proud and arrogant words asked my master where he was taking me. My master, somewhat astonished at the strange sights which had just seen, and ignorant of the Latin tongue, rode on and said nothing. The soldier, unable to restrain his insolence and offended at my master’s silence, struck him on the shoulders as he sat on my back. Then my master gently answered that he did not understand what he said. At this the soldier angrily demanded again where he was riding with his ass? “Indeed,” said the gardener, “to the next city.” “But I,” said the soldier, “have need of your ass, to carry the trusses of our captain from yonder castle.” Thereupon he took me by the halter and would violently have taken me away. But my master, wiping away the blood of the blow which he received from the soldier, asked him gently and civilly to take pity upon him and to let him depart with his possessions. He swore and affirmed that his slow ass, nearly dead with sickness, could scarce carry a few handfuls of herbs to the next town, much less any greater burdens. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.40.1#[40] But when he saw that the soldier would not be persuaded, but was ready with his staff to cleave my master’s head, my master fell down at his feet, ostensibly to move him to some pity. But when he saw the opportunity, he took the soldier by the legs and cast him upon the ground. Then he buffeted him, thumped him, bit him, and took a stone and beat his face and his sides, such that he could not turn and defend himself. The soldier could only threaten that if ever he rose, he would chop him in pieces. The gardener, when he heard him say so, took away the soldier’s spear, and when he had thrown it away, he knocked and beat him more cruelly then he did before. Thus the soldier had no way to save himself except by feigning that he was dead. Then my master took the javelin and mounted upon my back, riding in all haste to the next village. He did not desire to go to his garden and, when he to the village, he went to one of his friend’s houses and declared all the whole matter. He asked his friend to save his life and to hide him and his ass in some secret place until such time as all danger was past. Then his friend, not forgetting the ancient amity between them, entertained him willingly and led us upstairs into a chamber. There my master crept into a chest and lay there with the cover closed fast. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.41.1#[41] The soldier (as I afterwards learned) rose up as one awoken from a drunken sleep. But he could scarcely walk because of his wounds. However, at length and through the aid of his staff he came to the town. But he would not declare the matter to any person nor complain to any magistrate, lest he should be accused of cowardice. Yet in the end he told some of his companions what happened. Then they took him and hid him in some secret place, thinking that, beside the injury he had received, he would be accused of the breach of his faith since he had lost his spear. And when they had gotten a description of my master, they went to search him out. At last there was an unfaithful neighbor who told them where he was. Then the soldiers went to the magistrate declaring that they had lost on the road a silver goblet of their captain. They said a gardener had found it who, refusing to deliver the goblet, was hidden in one of his friend’s houses. By and by the magistrate, understanding the loss of the captain, came to the door of house where we were hidden and commanded our host to deliver my master on pain of death. However, these threats did not force him to confess that the gardener was within his house. But on account of his promise to safeguard of his friend, he said that he had not seen the gardener in a great while and did not know where he was. The soldiers said contrary. Thus, in order to know the truth of the matter, the magistrate commanded his sergeants and ministers to search every corner of the house. But they could find neither gardener nor ass. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:9.42.1#[42] Then there was a great argument between the soldiers and our host. For they said we were within the house and he said no. But I that was very curious to see what was going on. When I heard the disturbance I put my head out of the window to learn what was happening. It happened that one of the soldiers perceived my shadow, whereupon he began to shout that he had certainly seen me. Then they were all glad and came up into the chamber, and pulled me down like a prisoner. When they had found me, they searched more diligently and at length they found the gardener hidden in the chest. And so they brought the poor gardener before the magistrates. He was committed immediately to prison, but they could never stop laughing from the time they found me by my shadow. Wherefore has arisen the common proverb “the shadow of the ass.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.1.1#[1] I did not know how my master the gardener fared the next day. But the gentle soldier, who was well beaten for his cowardice, led me to his lodging without the objection of any man. There he loaded me up (as it seemed to me) like a military animal. For on the one side I bore a helmet that shined exceedingly. On the other side a shield that glittered even more. And on the top of my burden he put a long spear. These things he arranged conspicuously, not because he was so experienced in war (for the gardener proved the contrary) but so that he might frighten those who passed by when they saw such warlike equipment. When we had gone a good part of our journey over the plain and easy fields, we happened to come to a little town where we lodged at a certain captain’s house. And there the soldier took me to one of the servants, while he himself went towards his captain who was in charge of a thousand men. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.2.1#[2] After we had stayed there a few days, I learned of a wicked and mischievous deed committed there, which I have put in writing so that you may know it. The master of the house had a son, educated in good literature and endowed with virtuous manners, such as you would desire to have for a son. A long time earlier his mother had died, and when his father married a new wife and had another child, twelve years old. The stepmother was more excellent in beauty than honesty. She loved this young man, her son-in-law, either because she was unchaste by nature or because she was forced by fate to commit so great a mischief. Gentle reader, you do not read a fable here, but rather a tragedy. This woman, when her love was first kindled in her heart, could easily resist her desire and inordinate appetite because of fear that her intent should be known. But after it encompassed and burned every part of her breast, she was compelled to yield to the raging flame of Cupid and, under the pretense of the disease and infirmity of her body, she concealed the wound of her restless mind. Every man knows well the signs and tokens of love and its symptoms. Her countenance was pale, her eyes sorrowful, her knees weak, and there was no comfort for her but she continually wept and sobbed. You would have thought that she had some fever except that she wept immeasurably. The physicians could not diagnose her disease. They felt the beating of her veins, the intemperance of her heart, the sobbing sighs, and her tossing and turning. No, the cunning physician did not know what was going in, but a scholar of Venus might easily figure it out. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.3.1#[3] After that she had been tormented in her affliction for a long time and was no longer able to conceal her ardent desire, she caused called for her son (the word son she would not use if it were not for shame). He did not disobey his mother but with a sad and modest countenance came into the chamber of his stepmother, the mother of his brother. But she, speaking not a word, was in great doubt as to what she might do, and she could not tell what to say first since she was ashamed. The young man, suspecting no ill, with humble courtesy asked the cause of her present disease. Then she, having found an occasion to utter her intent, with weeping eyes and covered face, began boldly to speak to him in this manner. “You, you, are the original cause of all my grief. You are my comfort and only health, for your handsome eyes are so fixed within my breast that, unless they succor me, I shall certainly die. Have pity therefore upon me and do not be the occasion of my destruction. Do not let be afraid that you might offend your father since you shall save the life of your mother. Moreover, since you resemble your father’s form in every point, it gives me all the more cause to fancy you. Now is offered to you time and place. Now you have the occasion to work your will, seeing that we are alone. And it is a common saying: ‘Never known, never done.’” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.4.1#[4] This young man was troubled in by such an unexpected misfortune. Although he recoiled from committing so beastly a crime, yet he would not refuse her with a immediate denial, but warily pacified her mind with delay and promises. Wherefore he promised to do everything she desired. And in the meantime he wished his mother to be of good cheer and to comfort herself until he found some convenient time to come to her, when his father had gone out. By these means he got away from the pestilent sight of his stepmother. And knowing that this matter (which could involve the ruin of all the whole house) required the advice of wise and serious persons, he went immediately to a sage old man and declared the whole matter to him. The old man, after long deliberation, thought there was no better way to avoid the storm of cruel fortune to come than to run away. In the meantime the wicked woman, impatient of her love and the long delay of her son, urged her husband to ride abroad into far away lands. And then she asked the young man to fulfill his promises. But he, to get himself entirely out of her hands, always found excuses, until in the end she understood by the messengers that came in and out that he would not fulfill his promise. Then she, by as much she loved him before, by so much more she hated him now. And by and by she called one of her servants who was ready to engage in all kinds of mischief. To this servant she declared all her secrets. And there it was concluded between them that the best course was to kill the young man. Whereupon this wretch went immediately to buy poison, which he mingled with wine, in order to give it to the young man to drink and thereby kill him. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.5.1#[5] But while they were in deliberation as to how they might offer the poison to him, behold, here happened a strange occurrence. For the young son of the woman, who came from home school at noon and, being very thirsty, took the pot containing the poison. Ignorant of the venom, he drank a good amount of the poison which had been prepared to kill his brother. Whereupon he presently fell down to the ground dead. His schoolmaster, seeing his sudden change, called his mother and all the servants of the house with a loud voice. Immediately every man declared his opinion regarding the death of the child. But the cruel woman, who was an extreme example of a stepmother’s malice, was not moved by the bitter death of her son, by her own conscience of the crime, by the misfortune of her house, or by the grief of her husband. Instead she devised the destruction of all her family. For by and by she sent a messenger after her husband to tell him the great misfortune that happened after his departure. And when he came home, the wicked woman declared that his son had poisoned his brother because he would not consent to his will, and told him other lies adding, in the end, that he had threatened to kill her  because she had discovered the deed. Then the unhappy father was stricken with double grief for the death of his two children. For on the one hand he saw his younger son slain before his eyes, on the other, he seemed to see the elder condemned to die for his offence. Again, when he beheld his wife lamenting as she did, it gave him further occasion to hate his son all the more. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.6.1#[6] But the funeral of his younger son was scarcely finished when the old father, with weeping eyes even while returning from the grave, went to the Justice and accused his son of the slaughter of his brother. He testified how his son had threatened to slay his wife, and so by weeping and lamentation he moved all the magistrates and people to pity. Thus, without any delay or further inquiry, they all cried that the son should be stoned to death. But the Justices, fearing further problems arising from mob vengeance, and so that there might happen no sedition among the people, asked the decurions and other officers of the city to proceed to examine witnesses. They wanted justice according to the ancient custom, and not to formulate any hasty sentence or judgment without having heard both sides. They did not want to act like barbarous and cruel tyrants were accustomed to do. Otherwise they would give a bad example to their successors. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.7.1#[7] This opinion pleased everyone, and so the senators and counselors were called who, being placed in order according to their dignity, caused the accuser and defender to be brought forth. By the example of Athenian law, their advocates were commanded to plead their cases briefly, without preambles or attempts to arouse the people to pity. And if you demand how I learned of all this matter, you wall understand that I heard many tell it. But to recite what words the accuser used in his speech, what answer the defender made, the orations and pleadings of each party, verily I am not able to do. For I was bound fast to the manger. But what I learned and knew from others I will, God willing, declare to you. So it was ordered that, after the pleadings of both sides ended, the truth was to be found out through witnesses, and to set apart all presumptions and probabilities. They called in the servant who alone was reported to know all the matter. By and by the servant came in. He was in no way afraid of so great a judgment or of the presence of the judges or of his own guilty conscience, which he so finely dissembled. But with a bold countenance he presented himself before the justices and confirmed the accusation against the young man, saying, “O judges, one day this young man, loathing and hating his stepmother, called me and asked me to poison his brother so that he might take vengeance. If I would do this and keep the matter secret, he promised to give me a good reward for my trouble. But when the young man perceived that I would not do his will, he threatened to slay me. Thereupon he went himself and bought poison and, after he had tempered it with wine, gave it me to give to the child. When I refused, he offered it to his brother with his own hands.” When the wretched servant, with a trembling countenance, had ended his speech, which seemed like the truth, the trial was ended. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.8.1#[8] No judge or counselor was found who was so merciful to the young man accused that he found him not guilty. But they ordered that he should be put and sewn in a sack with a dog, a cock, a snake, and an ape, according to the law of parricide. Wherefore they wanted nothing but (as the ancient custom was) to put white and black stones into a pot and to take them out again to see whether the young man should be acquitted by judgment or condemned. This verdict was irrevocable. In the meantime the young man was delivered to the hands of the executioner. But there arose a wise and ancient physician, a man of a good conscience and credit throughout all the city, who covered the mouth of the pot in which the stones were being cast, and said, “I am glad, reverend judges, that I am a man of good reputation amongst you, whereby I am accounted as one who will not suffer any person to be put to death by false and untrue accusations. Understand that there has been no homicide or murder committed by this young man in this case and that you (being sworn to judge uprightly) have been misinformed and abused by invented lies and tales. For I cannot but declare my conscience lest I should be found to bear small honor and faith for the gods. Wherefore I pray you, give ear and I will show you the whole truth of the matter. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.9.1#[9] “You shall understand that this servant, who ought to be hanged, came one day to speak with me, promising to give me a hundred gold pieces if I would give him a powerful poison which would cause a man to die instantly. He said that he wanted it for someone who was sick with an incurable disease, so that he might be delivered from all torment. But, although I smelled his crafty and subtle intent and feared lest he should work some mischief with it, I nevertheless gave him a potion. But to so that I might free myself from all danger that might happen, I did not take the money he offered. But lest any of the coins lack weight or be found counterfeit, I told him to seal the purse in which they were placed with his signet ring. Thus the next day we might go together to the goldsmith to test them. This he did. Understanding that he had been brought before you this day, I hastily commanded one of my servants to fetch the purse which he had sealed and I have brought it here to you to see whether he will deny his own sign. And you may easily see that his words which he alleged against the young man, concerning the buying of the poison, are untrue. This proven by the fact that he bought the poison himself.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.10.1#[10] When the physician had spoken these words, you could perceive how the traitorous knave changed color, how he began to sweat for fear, how he trembled in every part of his body, and how he set one leg upon another, scratching his head and grinding his teeth. Thus there was no person who did not judge him culpable. In the end, when he was somewhat returned to his former subtlety, he began to deny all that was said and stoutly affirmed that the physician was lying. But the physician, perceiving that he was being railed at and that his words were being denied, never ceased affirming his statements and disproving the wretch. Finally the officers, by the command of the judges, bound the servant’s hands and brought out the seal with which he had sealed the purse. This increased the suspicion of him which was had already conceived. However, neither the fear of the wheel nor any other torment used by the Greeks (which were ready prepared), nor even the fire could force him to confess the matter. So obstinate and grounded was he in his mischievous mind. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.11.1#[11] But the physician, perceiving that the menaces of these torments did not move him, said, “I cannot suffer or abide that this young man, who is innocent, should against all law and conscience be punished and condemned to die. Nor can I allow this other, who is culpable, to escape so easily after mocking and flouting your judgment. For I will give you an evident proof and argument of this present crime. You shall understand that when this wretch demanded of me a quick and strong poison, I considered that it was not my part to give occasion of any other’s death but rather to cure and save sick persons by means of medicines. On the other hand, I feared lest, if I should deny his request, I might minister a further cause for his mischief. I thought he would either would buy poison of some other or else return and work his wicked intent with a sword or some dangerous weapon. And so I gave him not poison, but a drink of Mandragora, which causes any man to sleep as though he were dead. Neither is it any marvel if this most desperate man, who is certainly assured to be put to death in a way ordained by an ancient custom, can suffer and abide these facile and easy torments. But if the child has received the drink as I tempered it with my own hands, he is yet alive and is only asleep, and after his sleep he shall return to life again. But if he is dead indeed, then may you further enquire of the causes of his death.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.12.1#[12] The opinion of this ancient physician was found good, and every man desired to go to the tomb where the child had been placed. All of the Justices, all those of any reputation of the town, and all of the common people went to see this strange sight. Amongst them all was the father of the child. He removed with his own hands the stone of the tomb and found his son rising up after his dead and soporiferous sleep. When he beheld the child, he embraced him in his arms and presented him before the people with great joy and consolation. He was brought before the judges wrapped and bound as he been in his grave. Whereupon the wickedness of the servant and the treason of the stepmother were plainly discovered, and the truth of the matter was revealed. Whereby the woman was perpetually exiled and the servant hanged on a gallows. The physician was given the gold coins which had been prepared to buy the poison. Behold how the fortune of the old man was changed who, thinking that he had been deprived of all his kin and posterity, was in one moment made the father of two children. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.13.1#[13] But as for me, I was ruled and handled by fortune according to her pleasure. The soldier, who not paid a penny for me, was sent by the order of his captain to Rome to carry letters to the great emperor. Before he went, he sold me for eleven denars to two of his companions who were servants to a man of worship. Of these one was a baker who baked sweet bread and delicacies, and the other a cook who prepared fine and excellent foods for his master. These two lived in common and would drive me from place to place to carry such things as were necessary. I was received by these two as a third brother and companion, and so I thought I was never better situated than with them. For when night came, and supper was done, and their business had ended, they would bring many good morsels into their chamber for themselves. One would bring pigs, chickens, fish, and other good foods, the other fine bread, pastries, tarts, custards and other delicacies dipped in honey. And when they had shut their chamber door and had gone to the baths, o how I would fill my guts with these goodly dishes. Nor was I so much a fool or so much an ass that I would leave these dainty foods along and instead grind my teeth upon hard hay. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.14.1#[14] In this way I continued for a great while. I played the honest ass, taking but a little of one dish, and a little of another, and so no man distrusted me. In the end, I became bolder and began to devour whole dishes of the sweet delicacies. This caused the baker and the cook to suspect. However, they did mistrust me, but searched about to find the thief. At length they began to accuse one another of theft, and to keep track of the dishes and morsels of food so that they could learn what had been taken away. Eventually one of them was compelled to speak to his fellow: “Is it right to break promise and faith in this way, by stealing away the best food and selling it to increase your means? And yet you still have your part of what is left? If our partnership is not to your liking, we will be partners and brothers in other things, but in this we will break off. For I perceive that the great loss which I sustain will at length be a cause of great discord between us.” The other answered him, “Verily I praise your great subtlety, in that (when you have secretly taken away the food) you begin to complain first, whereas I for a long time have put up with you. I did not think it right to accuse my brother of theft, but I am glad that we have occasion to talk about the matter lest, by our silence, some contention might arise between us, like that which happened between Eteocles and his brother.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.15.1#[15] When they had reasoned together in this way, they both swore earnestly that neither of them had stolen or taken away any portion of the food. Wherefore they decided to search out the thief by every possible means. For they could not imagine that the ass, who stood alone there, would eat any such foods. Neither did they think that mice or insects were so ravenous as to devour whole dishes of food like the Harpies, who carried away the meals of Phineus the king of Arcadia. In the meantime, while I fed on dainty morsels, I grew fat, my skin became soft, and my hair began to shine. But this fair and comely shape of my body was cause of my undoing. The baker and cook marveled to see me so sleek and fine considering that I did not eat any hay at all. Wherefore, one day at their accustomed hour they went to the baths and locked their chamber door. It happened that, before they departed, they saw through a hole how I fell roundly to my victuals. Then they marveled greatly and did not care about the loss of their food, but laughed exceedingly, calling the servants of the house to show them the greedy appetite of the ass. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.16.1#[16] Their laughing was so immoderate that the master of the house heard them, and demanded the cause of their laughter. When he had heard the whole matter, he looked through the hole likewise, whereupon he was so delighted that he ordered that the door be opened so that he might see me at his pleasure. Then I, perceiving every man laugh, was not abashed, but rather more bold. Thus I did not stop eating until such time as the master of the house commanded me to be brought into his parlor as a novelty. There he caused all kinds of foods, which had never been touched, to be set on the table. These (although I had eaten sufficiently before, yet to win the further favor of the master of the house) I greedily devoured. And to prove my nature wholly, they gave me foods that every ass hates. They put before me beef and vinegar, birds and pepper, fish and sauce. In the meantime they who beheld me at the table did nothing but laugh. Then one of the servants of the house said to his master, “I pray you, sir, give him some drink for his supper.” The master answered, “Indeed, I think you’ve got it! For it may be that along with his food he would like to drink a cup of wine. Ho boy, wash yonder pot and fill it with wine! This done, carry it to the ass and say that I have drunk to him.” Then all the bystanders looked on to see what would come to pass. But I (as soon as I beheld the cup) did not delay long, but gathering my lips together lapped up all the wine at one draught. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.17.1#[17] The master, being quite joyful at this, had the baker and cook (who had bought me) come before him. He paid them four times as much as they had paid for me. This done, he committed me to one of his rich freedmen and charged him to look after me well. He said that I should not lack anything. The freedman obeyed his master’s command in every detail. And to that he might creep further into his master’s favor, he taught me a thousand tricks. First he instructed me to sit at the table on my tail, and how to leap and dance holding up my front feet. Moreover he taught me how to answer when anyone spoke to me by nodding my head, which was a strange and marvelous thing. And if I wanted something to drink, I was to look upon the pot. All these things I did willingly, and I followed his instruction. However, I could have done all these things without his teaching but I feared greatly lest, in showing myself cunning without a master, I would appear to be some great and strange wonder, and thereby be thrown out to wild beasts. But my fame was spread about in everyplace about the tricks which I could do. Thus my master was renowned throughout all the country because of me. For every man would say, “Behold the gentleman who has an ass that will eat and drink with him, that will dance, and understand what is said to him, and will show his desires by signs.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.18.1#[18] But first I will tell you (as I should have done before) who my master was, and of what country. His name was Thiasus, he was from Corinth, the principal town of Achaia, and he had obtained many offices of honor until he had taken the rank of Quinquennial. As his birth and dignity required, he wanted to show his worthiness and to purchase the benevolence of every person, and so he sponsored public games and triumphs of three days length. To bring his endeavor to pass he came to Thessaly to buy excellent beasts and valiant fighters for the purpose. When he had bought such things as were necessary, he did not return home into his country on chariots or wagons, nor would he ride upon Thessalian horses, or donkeys of France, or Spanish mules, as excellent beasts as can be found. Instead he caused me to be garnished and trimmed with trappings of gold and with a noble harness, with purple coverings, with a bridle of silver, with pictured cloths, and with shrilling bells. In this manner he rode upon me lovingly, speaking and entreating me with gentle words. But above all things he greatly rejoiced in the fact that I was both his servant to carry him and his companion to feed with him at the table. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.19.1#[19] After long time, when we had traveled both by sea and land and happened to arrive at Corinth, the people of the town came around us on every side. They did not so much honor Thiasus as they desired to see me. For my fame was so widely spread there that I gained my master much money, and when the people were desirous to see me play pranks, they caused the gates to be shut and required those who came to pay money. Because of this I was a profitable companion to them every day. There happened to be amongst the assembly a noble and rich matron who was much delighted to behold me. She could find no remedy for her passions and inordinate appetite, but continually desired to have her pleasure with me, as Pasiphae had with a bull. In the end she promised a great reward to my keeper for the custody of me for one night. He, for gain of a little money, accorded to her desire. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.20.1#[20] After I had dined in a parlor with my master, we went into our chamber where we found the fair matron who had waited a long thime for our arrival. I am not able to recite to you how all things were prepared. There were four eunuchs, who were setting on a bed of down on the ground with bolsters for us to lie on. The coverlet was of cloth of gold, and the pillows on which the delicate matron was accustomed to lay her head were soft and fluffy. Then the eunuchs, not wanting to delay any longer the pleasure of their mistress, closed the doors of the chamber and departed. Within the chamber were lamps that gave a clear light the whole place over. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.21.1#[21] Then she took off all her garments down to her naked skin and, taking the lamp that stood next to her, began to anoint all her body with balm, and mine likewise, but especially my nose. This done, she kissed me, not as they are accustomed to do in brothel houses or in the curtain schools for money, but purely, sincerely, and with great affection. While doing so she spoke these and like loving words: “You are the one I love, you are the only one I desire. Without you I cannot live.” She said these things and other similar preambles that women can use well enough when as they want to show or declare their burning passions and great affection of love. Then she took me by the halter and cast me down upon the bed. This was not objectionable to me since she was so beautiful a matron and since I was so filled with wine and perfumed with balm. Thus I was readily prepared for the purpose. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.22.1#[22] But nothing grieved me so much as to think how I, with my huge and great legs, could embrace so fair a matron, or how I should touch her fine, dainty, and silken skin with my hard hooves, or how it was possible to kiss her soft, pretty and ruddy lips with my monstrous mouth and stony teeth, or how she, who was young and tender, would be able to receive me. And indeed I thought that, if I should hurt the woman in any way, I would be thrown to the wild beasts. But in the meantime she kissed me and looked in my mouth with burning eyes, saying. “I have you, my pigeon, my sparrow!” Thereupon she showed that my fears were empty and embraced my body round about. Then she had her pleasure aggressively with me. Indeed I thought that I could not satisfy her, and that the mother of Minotaur had not quenched her inordinate desire with the bull. When night was passed, with much joy and small sleep, the matron went before day to my keeper to bargain with him for another night. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.23.1#[23] My keeper willingly granted this request, partly for gain of money, and partly to find a new pastime for my master. My master, after he had been fully briefed on my luxury, was very glad and rewarded my keeper well for his trouble, thinking he could show before all the people what I could do. But because they would not get the matron to perform such an act because of her dignity. And because they could find no other that would endeavor so great a reproach, at length they obtained for money a poor woman who had been condemned to be eaten by wild beasts. With this woman I was supposed to copulate in public. But first I will tell you the tale I heard concerning this woman. This woman had a husband whose father, wanting to ride forth, commanded his wife, whom he left at home great with child, that if she delivered a daughter, it should immediately be killed. When the time of her delivery came, it happened that she had a daughter whom she did not want to be slain because of the natural affection which she had for her child. She secretly committed the baby to one of her neighbors to nurse. And when her husband returned home, she declared to him that she had delivered a daughter whom (as he had commanded) she had caused to be put to death. But when this child came to age and was ready to be married, the mother was at a loss as to how she would dower her daughter and keep her husband from perceiving what was going on. Wherefore she disclosed the matter to her son who was the husband of the woman who had been condemned to be eaten by wild beasts. For she greatly feared lest he would unawares fancy or fall in love with his own sister. The young man, understanding the whole matter (to please and gratify his mother), went immediately to the young maiden, keeping the matter secret in his heart for fear of trouble. He, lamenting to see his sister forsaken by both mother and father, immediately dowered her with his own property and was going to marry her to one of his special and trusted friends. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.24.1#[24] But although he brought this to pass very secretly and sagely, yet in the end cruel fortune sowed great sedition in his house. For his wife (the one now condemned to beasts) became jealous of her husband and began to suspect the young woman as a harlot. Her jealousy grew to a point that she devised all kinds of ways to dispatch her. And in the end she invented this kind of mischief. She secretly stole her husband’s ring and went into the country where she commanded one of her trusty servants to take the ring to the maiden. He was told to declare to her that her brother wanted her to come into the country to him, and that she should come alone. And so that she would not delay, but come with all speed, he was to give her the ring as sufficient testimony of the message. This maiden, as soon as she had received the ring of her brother, was very willing and desirous to obey his command. She know nothing other than that he had sent for her, and so she went in all haste as the messenger told her to do. But when she came to the snare that had been prepared for her, the mischievous woman became like to one who had gone mad and who had become possessed by some ill spirit. When the poor maiden called for help with a loud voice to her brother, the wicked harlot (thinking that she had invented the story) took a burning firebrand and thrust it into her secret place, whereby she died miserably. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.25.1#[25] The husband of this maiden and her brother, advised of her death, came to the place where she was slain and, after great lamentation and weeping, they caused her to be buried honorably. Her brother, taking badly the miserable death of his sister (as well he should), conceived so great grief within his mind and was stricken with so pestilent fury of bitter anguish, that he fell into the burning heat of a dangerous fever. Thus he seemed in such a state that he needed to have some speedy remedy to save his life. The woman that slew the maiden, having lost the name of wife together with her faith, went to a treacherous physician who had killed a great many persons in his days, and promised him fifty pieces of gold if he would give her a strong poison to kill her husband. But in presence of her husband, she feigned that it was necessary for him to receive a certain kind of drink, which doctors call a sacred potion. She said it would purge the fever and clean out the interior parts of his body. But the physician, instead of that drink prepared a mortal and deadly poison and, when he had tempered it accordingly, he took the pot in the presence of the family and other neighbors and friends of the sick young man, and offered it to his patient. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.26.1#[26] But the bold and hardy woman, in order to accomplish her wicked intent and also obtain the money which she had promised the physician, stayed the pot with her hand, saying, “I pray you master physician, do not give this drink to my dear husband until you have drunk some part of it yourself. For I do not know whether you have mingled any poison in the drink. You should not be offended. For I know that you are a man of wisdom and learning. But I ask you to do this because of the conscience and love that I bear for the health and safety of my husband. The physician, being greatly troubled by the wickedness of this mischievous woman, did not at all know what to do. But so that he might not give any cause for suspicion to the bystanders or show any scruple of his guilty conscience, he, after a long delay, took the pot in his hand and presently drank a good draught of it. This done, the young man trustingly drank up the rest. The physician would have gone immediately home to take the counter-poison in order to expel and drive out the first poison. But the wicked woman, persevering in her mischief, would not allow him to depart until the poison began to work on him. Then, by much prayer and intercession, she let him go home. On the way the poison invaded the entrails and bowels of the whole body of the physician, such that with great pain he came to his own house. There he had scarce time to speak to his wife and to tell her to receive the promised payment for the death of two persons. Then he yielded up the ghost. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.27.1#[27] And the other young man lived not long after, but likewise died amongst the feigned and deceitful tears of his cursed wife. A few days later, when the young man was buried and the funeral had ended, the physician’s wife demanded of her the fifty pieces of gold which she promised her husband for the drink. At this the ill-disposed woman, with resemblance of honesty, answered her with gentle words and promised to give her the fifty pieces of gold, if she would fetch her a little of that same drink to proceed to make an end of her enterprise. The physician’s wife, partly to win the further favor of this rich woman and partly to gain the money, ran quickly home and brought her a whole root of poison. When she saw this, having now occasion to execute her further malice and to finish the damnable plot, she began to stretch out her bloody hands to murder. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.28.1#[28] She had a daughter by her husband (the one who was poisoned) who, according to law, was appointed heir of all the lands and goods of her father. But this woman, knowing that the mothers who succored their children would receive all their goods after their death, purposed to show herself a like parent to her child, as she was a wife to her husband. Whereupon she prepared a dinner with her own hands and poisoned both the wife of the physician and her own daughter. The child, being young and tender, died swiftly through the force of the drink. But the physician’s wife, being stout and strong of complexion, feeling the poison enter into her body, became suspicious. Thereupon, knowing for certain that she had was near death, she ran forthwith to the judges’ house. By means of her cries and exclamations, she raised up the people of the town. She, promising to show then diverse wicked and mischievous acts, caused the doors and gates to be opened. When she came in she declared from the beginning to the end the abomination of this woman. She had scarcely ended her tale when, opening her falling lips and grinding her teeth together, she fell down dead before the face of the judge. He, wanting to try the truth of the matter immediately, ordered that the cursed woman and her servants be pulled out of the house and forced, by pain of torment, to confess the deed. When this was known, the wicked woman, although it was far less then she deserved, but because there could be no more cruel a death invented for the quality of her offence, was condemned to be eaten with wild beasts. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.29.1#[29] Behold, with this woman I was appointed to copulate before the face of the people. But I, being wrapped in great anguish and dreading the day of the spectacle (when we two should so abandon ourselves together), devised rather to slay myself than to pollute my body with this mischievous harlot and so forever be defamed. But it was impossible for me to do so since I lacked hands and was not able to hold a knife in my hooves. However, standing in a pretty cabin, I rejoiced to see that spring time had come and that all things were flourishing. I was in good hope to find some roses and return myself to human shape. When the day of spectacle came, I was led with great pomp and benevolence to the appointed place. When I was brought there, I first saw the preamble of the games, dedicated with dancers and merry taunting jests. In the meantime I was placed before the gate of the theater where on the one side I saw green and fresh grass growing. Seeing this I greatly desired to feed. On the other side I very much delighted to see, when the theater gates were opened, how all things were finely prepared and set forth. For there I saw young children and maidens in the flower of their youth and attired gorgeously, dancing and moving in comely order, according to Greek custom. For sometimes they would dance in a line, sometimes round together, and sometimes they would divide themselves into four parts. But when the trumpet gave warning that every man should retire sit down, then the spectacle began in earnest. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.30.1#[30] First there was a hill of wood, not much unlike that which the poet Homer called Ida, for it was garnished about with all sorts of green verdures and lively trees. From its top ran down a clear and fresh fountain, nourishing the waters below. Around the wood were many young and tender goats plucking and feeding daintily on the budding trees. Then came a young man, a shepherd, representing Paris, richly arrayed in barbarian vestments. He had a miter of gold upon his head and he seemed as though he kept the goats. After him came another young man all naked except that his left shoulder was covered with a rich cloak. His head was shining with glistening hair that hung down, and through it you could perceive two little wings. Because of this you could conjecture that he was Mercury, with his rod called caduceus. He bore in his right hand an apple of gold, and with noble gait he went towards the one who was playing Paris. After he had given him the apple, he made a sign, signifying what Jupiter had commanded him to do. When he had given his message he departed away. And by and by, there approached a fair and comely maiden, not much unlike to Juno, for she had a diadem of gold upon her head, and in her hand she bore a regal scepter. Then followed another maiden resembling Pallas, for she had on her head a shining helmet on which was bound a garland of olive branches. She had in one hand a shield, and in the other a spear as though she would fight. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.31.1#[31] Then came another maiden who surpassed the others in beauty. She represented the goddess Venus with the color of ambrosia, thus as a young maiden. And so that she could show her perfect beauty, she appeared all naked, except that her fine and dainty skin was covered with a thin smock which the wind blew hither and thither to testify the youth and flower of the age of the girl. Her color was of two sorts, for her body was white as descended from heaven, and her smock was blue, as though it had come from the sea. After every one of the virgins (who represented goddesses) there followed certain waiting servants: Castor and Pollux went behind Juno who had on their heads helmets covered with stars. This Virgin Juno sounded a flute which she bore in her hand, and moved herself towards the shepherd Paris. She promised him that he would be lord of all Asia, if he would judge her the fairest of the three, and give her the apple of gold. The next maiden (who seemed by her armor to be Pallas) was accompanied by two young men armed and brandishing their naked swords in their hands; one was named Terror, and the other Fear. Behind them approached a man sounding his trumpet to provoke and stir men to battle. This maiden began to dance and shake her head, throwing her fierce and terrible eyes upon Paris and promising that if it pleased him to give her the victory of beauty, she would make him the most strong and victorious man alive. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.32.1#[32] Then came Venus who presented herself in the middle of the theater with much favor of all the people. For she was accompanied by a great many of youth whom you would have judged to be Cupids. These seemed either to have flown from heaven or else from the river of the sea, for they had wings, arrows, and the rest of their costume was appropriate in every way. And they bore in their hands lighted torches, as though it had been a day of marriage. Then came in a great multitude of fair maidens. On the one side were the most comely Graces, on the other side, the most beautiful Hours carrying garlands and loose flowers, and giving great honor to the goddess of pleasure. The flutes and pipes gave forth the sweet sound of the Lydian mode, whereby they pleased the minds of the bystanders exceedingly. But Venus, ever more pleasing to see, moved forward more and more and, shaking her head, answered by her motion and gesture to the sound of the instruments. For sometimes she would wink gently, sometimes she would stare threateningly, and sometimes she would dance only with her eyes. As soon as she had come before the judge, she promised to give him the fairest spouse of all the world, if he would prefer her above the rest of the goddesses. Then the young Phrygian shepherd Paris, with a willing mind, delivered the golden apple to Venus, which was the victory of beauty. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.33.1#[33] Why do you marvel, O Orators, Lawyers, and Advocates, if many of our judges nowadays sell their judgments for money? Why do you marvel when, in the beginning of the world, one Grace alone corrupted the sentence between God and men, and one rustical judge and shepherd, appointed by the counsel of great Jupiter, sold his judgment for a little pleasure, which afterward caused the ruin of his whole family? In like manner was sentence given between the noble Greeks. For the noble and valiant personage Palamedes was convicted for treason by false persuasion and accusation. And Ulysses, being of base condition, was preferred in military prowess over great Ajax. What judgment was there likewise amongst the Athenian lawyers who were wise and expert in all sciences? Was not Socrates preferred by Apollo above all the wise men in the world? Yet was he not, because of the envy and malice of wicked persons, executed by poison? Was he not charged with corrupting the youth of the country, whom he had always in fact kept under control? For we see nowadays that many excellent philosophers greatly desire to follow his sect, and by perpetual study value and study his works. But so that I may not be reproved for indignation by someone who might say, “What, shall we suffer an ass to play the Philosopher?” I will returne to my further purpose. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.34.1#[34] After the judgment of Paris ended, Juno and Pallas departed angrily, showing by their gesture that they would revenge themselves on Paris. But Venus, who was very pleased and glad in her heart, danced about the theater with much joy. This done, from the top of the hill (through a concealed spout) ran a fluid of the color of saffron. This fluid fell upon the goats and changed their white hair into yellow, and brought a sweet odor to all in the Theater. By and by certain engines caused the ground to open and the hill of wood to be swallowed up. And then behold, there came a man of arms through the multitude, demanding by the consent of the people the woman who had been condemned to the beasts and had been appointed to copulate with me. Our bed was finely prepared and covered with silk and other things necessary. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:10.35.1#[35] But I, on top of the shame of committing this horrible fact and of polluting my body with this wicked harlot, greatly feared the danger of death. For I thought to myself that, when she and I were together, the savage beast appointed to devour the woman would not distinguish between me and her. I considered that he would not temper his greediness such that he would tear her to pieces but spare me, knowing that I was innocent. Wherefore I was more concerned about safeguarding my life than I was about the shame. But in the meantime, while my master made ready the bed, the crowd was greatly delighted to see the hunting and other pleasing aspects of the games. Then I began to think and devise on my own behalf. When I perceived that no one was paying any attention to me (since I was such a tame and gentle ass), I stole out of the gate that was next me and I ran away as quickly as I could. I came to Cenchreae which is the most famous town of the Corinthians, bordering upon the Agean Sea and Saronic Gulf. Here there is a great and mighty harbor frequented by many different nations. There, because I wanted to avoid the multitude of the people, I went to a hidden place on the seacoast. There I laid myself down upon the sand to ease and refresh myself. The day was past and the sun had gone down, and so, lying on the ground in this way, I fell sound asleep. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.1.1#[1] When midnight came, after I had slept awhile, I awoke with sudden fear, and saw the moon shining bright, as when it is full, and seeming as though it leapt out of the sea. I thought to myself that this was the time when the goddess had most power and force, and when all human affairs are governed by her providence. Not only all tame and domestic beasts, but also all wild and savage beasts are under her protection. I considered that all bodies in the heavens, the earth and the seas are by her waxing increased and by her waning diminished. Since I was weary of all my cruel fortune and calamity, I found good hope and remedy. Though it was very late, I though I could be delivered from all my misery, by invocation and prayer, to the excellent beauty of the goddess, whom I saw shining before my eyes. Wherefore, shaking off drowsy sleep, I arose with a joyful face and, moved by a great desire to purify myself, I plunged seven times into the water of the sea. This number of seven is agreeable to holy and divine things, as the worthy and sage philosopher Pythagoras declared. Then, with a weeping countenance, I made this prayer to the powerful goddess: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.2.1#[2] “O blessed queen of heaven, you are the Lady Ceres, who is the original and motherly nurse of all fruitful things on earth. You, after finding your daughter Proserpina, through the great joy which you presently conceived, made barren and unfruitful ground be plowed and sown. And now you dwell in the land of Eleusis. Or else you are the celestial Venus who, in the beginning of the world coupled together all kind of things with engendered love. By an eternal propagation of humankind, you are now worshipped within the temples of Paphos. You are also the sister of the god Phoebus, who nourishes so many people by the generation of beasts, and are now adored at the sacred places of Ephesus. You are terrible Proserpina, by reason of the deadly cries that you wield. You have the power to stop and put away the invasion of the hags and ghosts that appear to men, and to keep them down in the closures of the earth. You are worshipped in diverse ways, and illuminate all the borders of the earth by your feminine shape. You nourish all the fruits of the world by your vigor and force. By whatever name or fashion it is lawful to call you, I pray you to end my great travail and misery, and to deliver me from wretched fortune, which has so long pursued me. Grant peace and rest, if it pleases you, to my adversities, for I have endured too much labor and peril. Remove from me the shape of an ass and render to me my original form. And if I have offended in any point your divine majesty, let me rather die than live, for I am full weary of my life.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.3.1#[3] When I had ended this prayer and discovered my complaints to the goddess, I happened to fall asleep. By and by appeared a divine and venerable face, worshipped even by the gods themselves. Then, little by little, I seemed to see the whole figure of her body, mounting out of the sea and standing before me. Wherefore I intend to describe her divine semblance, if the poverty of human speech will allow me, or if her divine power gives me eloquence to do so. First she had a great abundance of hair dispersed and scattered about her neck. On the crown of her head she bore many garlands interlaced with flowers. In the middle of her forehead was a compass like mirror, or resembling the light of the moon. In one of her hands she bore serpents, in the other, blades of grain. Her vestment was of fine silk of diverse colors, sometimes yellow, sometimes rosy, sometimes the color of flame. Her robe (which troubled my spirit sorely) was dark and obscure, and pleated in most subtle fashion at the skirts of her garments. Its fringe appeared comely. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.4.1#[4] Here and there the stars were seen, and in the middle of them was placed the moon which shone like a flame of fire. Round about the robe was a coronet or garland made with flowers and fruits. In her right hand she had a rattle of brass which gave a pleasant sound, in her left hand she bore a cup of gold, and from its mouth the serpent Aspis lifted up his head, with a swelling throat. Her odoriferous feet were covered with shoes interlaced and wrought with the palm of victory. Thus the divine shape, breathing out the pleasant spice of fertile Arabia, did not disdain to utter these words to me with her divine voice: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.5.1#[5] “Behold, Lucius, I have come! Your weeping and prayers have moved me to succor you. I am she who is the natural mother of all things, mistress and governess of all the elements, the initial progeny of worlds, chief of powers divine, queen of heaven! I am the principal of the celestial gods, the light of the goddesses. At my will the planets of the heavens, the wholesome winds of the seas, and the silences of hell are disposed. My name and my divinity is adored throughout all the world in diverse manners. I am worshipped by various customs and by many names. The Phrygians call me the mother of the gods. The Athenians, Minerva. The Cyprians, Venus. The Cretans, Diana. The Sicilians, Proserpina. The Eleusians, Ceres. Some call me Juno, other Bellona, and yet others Hecate. And principally the Aethiopians who dwell in the Orient, and the Aegyptians who are excellent in all kind of ancient doctrine and by their proper ceremonies are accustomed to worship me, call me Queen Isis. Behold, I have come to take pity of your fortune and tribulation. Behold, I am present to favor and aid you. Leave off your weeping and lamentation, put away all your sorrow. For behold, the day which is ordained by my providence is at hand. Therefore be ready to attend to my command. This day which shall come after this night is dedicated to my service by an eternal religion. My priests and ministers are accustomed, after the tempests of the sea have ceased, to offer in my name a new ship as a first fruit of my navigation. I command you not to profane or despise the sacrifice in any way. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.6.1#[6] “The great priest shall carry this day, following in procession by my exhortation, a garland of roses next the rattle in his right hand. Follow my procession amongst the people and, when you come to the priest, make as though you would kiss his hand. But snatch at the roses, whereby I will put away the skin and shape of an ass. This kind of beast I have long abhorred and despised. But above all things beware that you do not doubt or fear any of those things as being hard and difficult to bring to pass. For in the same hour as I have come to you, I have commanded the priest, by a vision, of what he shall do. And all the people by my command shall be compelled to give you place and say nothing! Moreover, do not think that, amongst so fair and joyful ceremonies and in so good a company, any person shall abhor your ill-favored and deformed figure, or that any man shall be so hardy as to blame and reprove your sudden restoration to human shape. They will not conceive any sinister opinion about this deed. And know this for certain: for the rest of your life, until the hour of death, you shall be bound and subject to me! And think it not an injury to be always subject to me, since by my means and benefit you shall become a man. You shall live blessed in this world, you shall live gloriously by my guidance and protection. And when you descend to hell, you shall see me shine in that subterranean place, shining (as you see me now) in the darkness of Acheron, and reigning in the deep profundity of Styx. There you shall worship me as one who has been favorable to you. And if I perceive that you are obedient to my command, an adherent to my religion, and worthy my divine grace, know you that I will prolong your days above the time that the fates have appointed, and the celestial planets have ordained.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.7.1#[7] When the divine image had spoken these words, she vanished away! By and by, when I awoke, I arose with the members of my body mixed with fear, joy and sweat. I marveled at the clear presence of the powerful goddess and, being sprinkled with the water of the sea, I recounted in order her admonitions and divine commands. Soon after, when the darkness was chased away and the clear and golden sun rose, behold, I saw the streets filled with people going in a religious sort and in great triumph. All things seemed that day to be joyful. Every beast and house, and indeed the very day itself seemed to rejoice. For after a frosty morning a hot and temperate rose and the little birds, thinking that the spring time had come, chirped and sang melodiously to the mother of stars, the parent of times, and mistress of all the world! The fruitful trees rejoiced at their fertility. The barren and sterile were contented to provide shadows. All rendering sweet and pleasant sounds with their branches. The seas were quiet from winds and tempests. In heaven the clouds had been chased away, and the sky appeared fair and clear with its proper light. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.8.1#[8] Behold, then more and more there appeared the parades and processions. The people were attired in regal manner and singing joyfully. One was girded about the middle like a man of arms. Another was bare and spare, and had a cloak and high shoes like a hunter! Another was attired in a robe of silk and socks of gold, having his hair laid out and dressed like a woman! There was another who wore leg harnesses and bore a shield, a helmet, and a spear like a martial soldier. After him marched one attired in purple, with vergers before him like a magistrate! After him followed one with a cloak, a staff, a pair of sandals, and a gray beard, signifying that he was a philosopher. After him came one with a line, betokening a fowler. Another came with hooks, declaring him a fisherman. I saw there a meek and tame bear which, dressed like a matron, was carried on a stool. An ape, with a bonnet on his head and covered with a Phrygian garment, resembled a shepherd, and bore a cup of gold in his hand. There was an ass, which had wings glued to his back and followed an old man: you would judge the one to be Pegasus, and the other Bellerophon. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.9.1#[9] Amongst the pleasures and popular delights which wandered hither and thither, you might see the procession of the goddess triumphantly marching forward. The women, attired in white vestments and rejoicing because they wore garlands and flowers upon their heads, bedspread the road with herbs which they bare in their aprons. This marked the path this regal and devout procession would pass. Others carried mirrors on their backs to testify obeisance to the goddess who came after. Other bore combs of ivory and declared by the gesture and motions of their arms that they were ordained and ready to dress the goddess. Others dropped balm and other precious ointments as they went. Then came a great number of men as well as women with candles, torches, and other lights, doing honor to the celestial goddess. After that sounded the musical harmony of instruments. Then came a fair company of youths, appareled in white vestments, singing both meter and verse a comely song which some studious poet had made in honor of the Muses. In the meantime there arrived the blowers of trumpets, who were dedicated to the god Serapis. Before them were officers who prepared room for the goddess to pass. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.10.1#[10] Then came the great company of men and women who had taken divine orders and whose garments glistened all the streets over. The women had their hair anointed and their heads covered with linen. But the men had their crowns shaven, which were like earthly stars of the goddess. They held in their hands instruments of brass, silver and gold, which rendered a pleasant sound. The principal priests, who were appareled with white surpluses hanging down to the ground, bore the relics of the powerful goddess. One carried in his hand a light, not unlike to those which we used in our houses, except that in the middle of it there was a bole which rendered a brighter flame. The second, attired like the other, bore in his hand an altar which the goddess herself named the succor of nations. The third held a tree of palm, with leaves of gold, and the verge of Mercury. The fourth showed a token of equity in his left hand, which was deformed in every place, signifying more equity then by the right hand. The same priest carried a round vessel of gold in the form of a cap. The fifth bore a van, wrought with springs of gold, and another carried a vessel for wine. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.11.1#[11] By and by, after the goddess, there followed gods on foot. There was Anubis, the messenger of the gods infernal and celestial, with his face sometimes black, sometimes faire, lifting up the head of a dog and bearing in his left hand his verge, and in his right hand the branches of a palm tree. After whom followed a cow with an upright gait, representing the figure of the great goddess. He who guided her marched on with much gravity. Another carried the secrets of their religion closed in a coffer. There was one who bore on his stomach a figure of his god, not formed like any beast, bird, savage thing or humane shape, but made by a new invention. This signified that such a religion could not be discovered or revealed to any person. There was a vessel wrought with a round bottom, having on the one side pictures figured in the manner of the Egyptians, and on the other side was an ear on which stood the serpent Aspis, holding out his scaly neck. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.12.1#[12] Finally came he who was appointed to my good fortune, according to the promise of the goddess. For the great priest, who bore the restoration of my human shape by the command of the goddess, approached ever closer bearing in his left hand the rattle, and in the other a garland of roses to give me. This was to deliver me from cruel fortune, which was always my enemy after I had suffered so much calamity and pain and had endured so many perils. I did not approach hastily, though I was seized by sudden joy, lest I disturb the quiet procession by my eagerness. But going softly through the press of the people (which gave way to me on every side) I went up to the priest. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.13.1#[13] The priest, having been advised the night before, stood still and holding out his hand, and thrust out the garland of roses into my mouth. I (trembling) devoured it with a great eagerness. And as soon as I had eaten them, I found that the promise made to me had not been in vain. For my deformed face changed, and first the rugged hair of my body fell off, my thick skin grew soft and tender, the hooves of my feet changed into toes, my hands returned again, my neck grew short, my head and mouth became round, my long ears were made little, my great and stony teeth grew more like the teeth of men, and my tail, which had burdened me most, disappeared. Then the people began to marvel. The religious honored the goddess for so evident a miracle. They wondered at the visions which they saw in the night, and the ease of my restoration, whereby they rendered testimony of so great a benefit that I had received from the goddess. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.14.1#[14] When I saw myself in such a state, I stood still a while and said nothing. I could not tell what to say, nor what word I should speak first, nor what thanks I should render to the goddess. But the great priest, understanding all my fortune and misery through divine warning, commanded that someone should give me garments to cover myself with. However, as soon as I was transformed from an ass to my humane shape, I hid my private parts with my hands as shame and necessity compelled me. Then one of the company took off his upper robe and put it on my back. This done, the priest looked upon me and with a sweet and benign voice said: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.15.1#[15] “O my friend Lucius, after the enduring so many labors and escaping so many tempests of fortune, you have at length come to the port and haven of rest and mercy. Your noble linage, your dignity, your education, or any thing else did not avail you. But you have endured so many servile pleasures due to the folly of youth. Thusly you have had an unpleasant reward for your excessive curiosity. But however the blindness of Fortune has tormented you in various dangers, so it is now that, unbeknownst to her, you have come to this present felicity. Let Fortune go and fume with fury in another place. Let her find some other matter on which to execute her cruelty. Fortune has no power against those who serve and honor our goddess. What good did it do her that you endured thieves, savage beasts, great servitude, dangerous waits, long journeys, and fear of death every day? Know that now you are safe and under the protection of her who, by her clear light, brightens the other gods. Wherefore rejoice and take a countenance appropriate to your white garment. Follow the parade of this devout and honorable procession so that those who do not worship the goddess may see and acknowledge their error. Behold Lucius, you are delivered from so great miseries by the providence of the goddess Isis. Rejoice therefore and triumph in the victory over fortune. And so that you may live more safe and sure, make yourself one of this holy order. Dedicate your mind to our religion and take upon yourself the voluntary yoke of ministry. And when you begin to serve and honor the goddess, then you shall feel the fruit of your liberty.” <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.16.1#[16] After the great priest had prophesied in this manner, he, regaining his breath, made a conclusion of his words. Then I went amongst the rest of the company and followed the procession. Everyone of the people knew me and, pointing at me with their fingers, spoke in this way, “Behold him who was this day transformed into a man by the power of the sovereign goddess. Verily he is blessed and most blessed, who has merited such great grace from heaven both because of the innocence of his former life. He has been reborn in the service of the goddess. In the meantime, little by little we approached near to the sea cost, near that place where I lay the night before, still an ass. Thereafter the images and relics were disposed in order. The great priest was surrounded by various pictures according to the fashion of the Aegyptians. He dedicated and consecrated with certain prayers a fair ship made very cunningly, and purified it with a torch, an egg, and sulfur. The sail was of white linen cloth on which was written certain letters which testified that the navigation would be prosperous. The mast was of a great length, made of a pine tree, round and very excellent with a shining top. The cabin was covered over with coverings of gold, and the whole ship was made of citron tree, very fair. Then all the people, religious as well as profane, took a great number of baskets filled with odors and pleasant smells and threw them into the sea, mingled with milk, until the ship was filled with many gifts and prosperous devotions. Then, with a pleasant wind, the ship was launched out into the deep. But when they had lost the sight of the ship, every man carried again that he brought, and went toward the temple in like procession and order as they had come to the sea side. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.17.1#[17] When we had come to the temple, the great priest and those who were assigned to carry the divine images (but especially those who had long been worshippers of the religion) went into the secret chamber of the goddess where they placed the images in order. This done, one of the company, who was a scribe or interpreter of letters, in the manner of a preacher stood up on a chair before the holy college and began to read out of a book. He began pronounce benedictions upon the great emperor, the senate, the knights, and generally to all the Roman people, and to all who are under the jurisdiction of Rome. These words following signified the end of their divine service and that it was lawful for every man to depart. Whereupon all the people gave a great shout and, filled with much joy, bore all kind of herbs and garlands of flowers home to their houses, kissing and embracing the steps where the goddess had passed. However, I could not do as the rest did, for my mind would not allow me to depart one foot away. This was how eager I was to behold the beauty of the goddess, remembering the great misery I had endured. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.18.1#[18] In the meantime news was carried into my country (as swift as the flight of birds or as the blast of winds) of the grace and benefit which I received from the goddess, and of my story, worthy to be remembered. Then my parents, friends, and servants of our house, understanding that I was not dead (as they had been falsely informed), came with great diligence to see me, as though I were man raised from death to life. And I, who never thought I would see them again, was as joyful as they were, accepting and taking in good part their honest gifts and oblations so as to buy such things as were necessary for my body. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.19.1#[19] After I had related to them of all my former miseries and present joys, I went before the face of the goddess and hired a house within the cloister of the temple so that I might continually be ready to serve of the goddess. I also wanted to be in continual contact with the company of the priests so that I could become wholly devoted to the goddess, and become an inseparable worshipper of her divine name. It happened that the goddess often appeared to me in the night, urging and commanding me to take the order of her religion. But I, though I greatly desired to do so, was held back because of fear. I considered her discipline was hard and difficult, the chastity of the priests intolerable, and the life austere and subject to many inconveniences. Being thus in doubt, I refrained from all those things as seeming impossible. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.20.1#[20] One night the great priest appeared to me, presenting his lap full of treasure. And when I demanded what it signified, he answered, that it was sent to me from the country of Thessaly, and that a servant of mine named Candidus was arrived likewise. When I was awoke, I mused to myself what this vision should portend, considering that I had never any servant called by that name. But whatever it signified, this I verily thought: that it foretold gain and prosperous fortune. While I was thus astonished, I went to the temple and tarried there until the opening of the gates. Then I went in and began to pray before the face of the goddess. The priest prepared and set the divine things of each altar and pulled out the fountain and holy vessel with solemn supplication. Then they began to sing the matins of the morning, signifying the hour of the prime. By and by behold, there arrived the servant whom I had left in the country, when Fotis by error made me an ass. He brought my horse whom he had recovered by certain signs and tokens which I had put on its back. Then I perceived the interpretation of my dream: by the promise of gain, my white horse was restored to me, which was signified by the argument of my servant Candidus. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.21.1#[21] This done, I retired to the service of the goddess in hope of greater benefits. I considered that I had received a sign and token whereby my courage increased more and more each day to take up the orders and sacraments of the temple. Thus I often communed with the priest, desiring him greatly to give me the degree of the religion. But he, a man of gravity and well-renowned in the order of priesthood, deferred my desire from day to day. He comforted me and gave me better hope, just like as parents who commonly bridle the desires of their children when they attempt or endeavor any unprofitable thing. He said that the day when any one would be admitted into their order is appointed by the goddess. He said that the priest who would minister the sacrifice is chosen by her providence, and the necessary charges of the ceremonies is allotted by her command. Regarding all these things he urged me to attend with marvelous patience, and he told me that I should beware either of too much haste or too great slackness. He said that there was like danger if, being called, I should delay or, not being called. I should be hasty. Moreover he said that there were none in his company either of so desperate a mind or who were so rash and hardy that they would attempt anything without the command of the goddess. If anyone were to do so, he should commit a deadly offence, considering how it was in the power of the goddess to condemn and save all persons. And if anyone should be at the point of death and on the path to damnation, so that he might be capable of receiving the secrets of the goddess, it was in her power by divine providence to reduce him to the path of health, as though by a certain kind of regeneration. Finally he said that I must attend the celestial precept, although it was evident and plain that the goddess had already vouchsafed to call and appoint me to her ministry. He urged me to refrain from profane and unlawful foods just like those priests who had already been received. This was so that I might come more apt and clean to the knowledge of the secrets of religion. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.22.1#[22] I obeyed these words and, attentive with meek and laudable silence, I daily served at the temple. In the end the wholesome gentleness of the goddess did not deceive me, for in the night she appeared to me in a vision. She showed me that the day had come which I had wished for so long. She told me what provision and charges I should attend to, and how she had appointed her principal priest Mithras to be minister with me in my sacrifices. When I heard these divine commands I greatly rejoiced. I arose before dawn to speak with the great priest, whom I happened to see coming out of his chamber. Then I saluted him and thought that I should ask for his counsel with a bold courage. But as soon as he perceived me, he began first to say: “O Lucius, now I know well that you are most happy and blessed, whom the divine goddess accepts with such mercy. Why do you delay? Behold, it is the day which you desired, when you shall receive at my hands the order of religion and know the most pure secrets of the gods.” Whereupon the old man took me by the hand and led me to the gate of the great temple. Immediately upon entering he made a solemn celebration and, after morning sacrifice had ended, he brought books out of the secret place of the temple. These were partly written in unknown characters, and partly painted with figures of beasts declaring briefly every sentence. The heads and tails of some were turned in the shape of a wheel and were strange and impossible for profane people to read. There he interpreted to me such things as were necessary for the use and preparation of my order. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.23.1#[23] This done, I gave charge to certain of my companions to buy liberally whatever was necessary and appropriate. Then the priest brought me to the baths nearby, accompanied with all the religious sort. He, demanding pardon of the goddess, washed me and purified my body according to custom. After this, when no one approached, he brought me back again to the temple and presented me before the face of the goddess. He told me of certain secret things that it was unlawful to utter, and he commanded me, and generally all the rest, to fast for the space of ten continual days. I was not allowed to eat any beast or drink any wine. These strictures I observed with marvelous continence. Then behold, the day approached when the sacrifice was to be made. And when night came there arrived on every coast a great multitude of priests who, according to their order, offered me many presents and gifts. Then all the laity and profane people were commanded to depart. When they had put on my back a linen robe, they brought me to the most secret and sacred place of all the temple. You will perhaps ask (o studious reader) what was said and done there. Verily I would tell you if it were lawful for me to tell. You would know if it were appropriate for you to hear. But both your ears and my tongue shall incur similar punishment for rash curiosity. However, I will content your mind for this present time, since it is perhaps somewhat religious and given to devotion. Listen therefore and believe it to be true. You shall understand that I approached near to Hell, and even to the gates of Proserpina. After I was brought through all the elements, I returned to my proper place. About midnight I saw the sun shine, and I saw likewise the celestial and infernal gods. Before them I presented myself and worshipped them. Behold, now have I told you something which, although you have heard it, it is necessary for you to conceal. This much have I declared without offence for the understanding of the profane. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.24.1#[24] When morning came, and that the solemnities were finished, I came forth sanctified with twelve robes and in a religious habit. I am not forbidden to speak of this since many persons saw me at that time. There I was commanded to stand upon a seat of wood which stood in the middle of the temple before the image of the goddess. My vestment was of fine linen, covered and embroidered with flowers. I had a precious cloak upon my shoulders hung down to the ground. On it were depicted beasts wrought of diverse colors: Indian dragons and Hyperborean griffins which the other world engenders in the form of birds. The priests commonly call such a habit a celestial robe. In my right hand I carried a lit torch. There was a garland of flowers upon my head with palm leaves sprouting out on every side. I was adorned like un the sun and made in fashion of an image such that all the people came up to behold me. Then they began to solemnize the feast of the nativity and the new procession, with sumptuous banquets and delicacies. The third day was likewise celebrated with like ceremonies with a religious dinner, and with all the consummation of the order. After I had stayed there a good space, I conceived a marvelous pleasure and consolation in beholding the image of the goddess. She at length urged me to depart homeward. I rendered my thanks which, although not sufficient, yet they were according to my power. However, I could not be persuaded to depart before I had fallen prostrate before the face of the goddess and wiped her steps with my face. Then I began greatly to weep and sigh (so uch so that my words were interrupted) and, as though devouring my prayer, I began to speak in this way: <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.25.1#[25] “O holy and blessed lady, the perpetual comfort of humankind: you, by your bounty and grace, nourish all the world and listen with great affection to the adversities of the miserable. As a loving mother you take no rest, neither are you idle at any time in bestowing benefits and succoring all men on land as well as on the sea. You are she who puts away all storms and dangers from man’s life by your right hand. Whereby also you restrain the fatal dispositions, appease the great tempests of fortune, and keep back the course of the stars. The celestial gods honor you and the infernal gods keep you in reverence. You encompass all the world, you give light to the sun, you govern the world, you strike down the power of hell. Because of you the times return and the planets rejoice, and the elements serve you. At your command the winds blow, the clouds increase, the seeds prosper, and the fruits prevail. The birds of the air, the beasts of the hill, the serpents of the den, and the fishes of the sea tremble at your majesty. But my spirit is not able to give you sufficient praise, my patrimony is unable to satisfy your sacrifice, my voice has no power to utter that which I think. No, not if I had a thousand mouths and so many tongues. However, as a good religious person and, according to my estate, I will always keep you in remembrance and close you within my breast.” When I had ended my prayer, I went to embrace the great priest Mithras, my spiritual father, and to demand his pardon, since I was unable to recompense the good which he had done to me. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.26.1#[26] After great greeting and thanks I departed from him to visit my parents and friends. And after a while, by the exhortation of the goddess, I made up my packet, and took shipping toward the city of Rome, where (with a favorable wind) I arrived about the twelfth day of December. And the greatest desire I had there was to make my daily prayers to the sovereign goddess Isis. She, because of the place where her temple was built, was called Campensis, and was continually adored of the people of Rome. Although I was her minister and worshipper, I was a stranger to her temple and unknown to her religion there. When a year had gone by, the goddess advised me again to receive this new order and consecration. I marveled greatly what it signified and what should happen, considering that I was a sacred person already. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.27.1#[27] But it happened that, while I reasoned with myself and while I examined the issue with the priests, there came a new and marvelous thought in my mind. I realized that I was only consecrated to the goddess Isis, but not sacred to the religion of great Osiris, the sovereign father of all the goddesses. Between them, although there was a religious unity and concord, yet there was a great difference of order and ceremony. And because it was necessary that I should likewise be a devotee of Osiris, there was no long delay. For the night after there appeared to me one of that order, covered with linen robes. He held in his hands spears wrapped in ivy and other things not appropriate to declare. Then he left these things in my chamber and, sitting in my seat, recited to me such things as were necessary for the sumptuous banquet for my initiation. And so that I might know him again, he showed me how the ankle of his left foot was somewhat maimed, which gave him a slight limp. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.27.2#Afterwards I manifestly knew the will of the god Osiris. When matins ended, I went from one priest to another to find the one who had the halting mark on his foot, according to my vision. At length I found it true. I perceived one of the company of the priests who had not only the token of his foot, but the stature and habit of his body, resembling in every point the man who appeared in the nigh. He was called Asinius Marcellus, a name appropriate to my transformation. By and by I went to him and he knew well enough all the matter. He had been admonished by a similar precept in the night. For the night before, as he dressed the flowers and garlands about the head of the god Osiris, he understood from the mouth of the image (which told the predestinations of all men) how the god had sent him a poor man of Madauros. To this man the priest was supposed to minister his sacraments so that he could receive a reward by divine providence, and the other glory for his virtuous studies. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.28.1#[28] Thus I was initiated into the religion, but my desire was delayed by reason of my poverty. I had spent a great part of my goods in travel and peregrination, but most of all the cost of living in the city of Rome had dwindled my resources. In the end, being often stirred forward with great trouble of mind, I was forced to sell my robe for a little money which was nevertheless sufficient for all my affairs. Then the priest spoke to me saying, “How is it that for a little pleasure you are not afraid to sell your vestments, yet when you enter into such great ceremonies you fear to fall into poverty? Prepare yourself and abstain from all animal meats, beasts and fish.” In the meantime I frequented the sacrifices of Serapis, which were done in the night. This gave me great comfort to my peregrination, and ministered to me more plentiful living since I gained some money by pleading in the courts in the Latin language. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.29.1#[29] Immediately afterwards I was called upon by the god Osiris and admonished to receive a third order of religion. Then I was greatly astonished, because I could not tell what this new vision signified or what the intent of the celestial god was. I began to suspect the former priests of having given me ill counsel, and I feared that they had not faithfully instructed me. While I was, as it were, incensed because of this, the god Osiris appeared to me the following night and gave me admonition, saying, “There is no reason why you should be afraid of these many orders of religion, or that something has been omitted. You should rather rejoice since as it has pleased the gods to call upon you three times, whereas most do not achieve the order even once. Wherefore you should think yourself happy because of our great benefits. And know that the initiation which you must now receive is most necessary if you mean to persevere in the worship of the goddess. You will be able to participate in solemnity on the festival day adorned in the blessed habit. This shall be a glory and source of renown for you. <br><br>
urn:cts:latinLit:phi1212.phi002.chin:11.30.1#[30] In this way the divine majesty persuaded me in my sleep. Whereupon I went to the priest and declared all that I had seen. Then I fasted for ten days, according to the custom, and of my own free will I abstained longer than I had been commanded. And verily I did not repent of the pain I had gone through and of the charges I had undertaken. This was because the divine providence had seen to it that I gained much money in pleading of causes. Finally, after a few days, the great god Osiris appeared to me at night, not disguised in any other form, but in his own essence. He commanded me to be an advocate in the court, and not fear the slander and envy of ill persons who begrudged me by for the religion which I had attained by much labor. Moreover, he would not suffer that I should be any longer of the number of his priests, but he allotted me to one of the higher positions. And after he appointed me a place within the ancient temple, which had been erected in the time of Sulla, I executed my office in great joy and with a shaved head. <br><br>
